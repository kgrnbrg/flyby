The Burial of the Dead

April is the cruellest month breeding
Lilacs out of the dead land mixing 
Memory and desire stirring 
Dull roots with spring rain 
Winter kept us warm covering 
Earth in forgetful snow feeding 
A little life with dried tubers 
Summer surprised us coming over the Starnbergersee 
With a shower of rain we stopped in the colonnade 
And went on in sunlight into the Hofgarten 
And drank coffee and talked for an hour 
Bin gar keine Russin stamm aus Litauen echt deutsch 
And when we were children staying at the archdukes 
My cousins he took me out on a sled 
And I was frightened He said Marie 
Marie hold on tight And down we went 
In the mountains there you feel free 
I read much of the night and go south in the winter 

What are the roots that clutch what branches grow 
Out of this stony rubbish Son of man 
You cannot say or guess for you know only 
A heap of broken images where the sun beats 
And the dead tree gives no shelter the cricket no relief 
And the dry stone no sound of water Only 
There is shadow under this red rock 
Come in under the shadow of this red rock 
And I will show you something different from either 
Your shadow at morning striding behind you 
Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you 
I will show you fear in a handful of dust 
Frisch weht der Wind 
Der Heimat zu 
Mein Irisch Kind 
Wo weilest du 
You gave me hyacinths first a year ago 
They called me the hyacinth girl
Yet when we came back late from the Hyacinth garden 
Your arms full and your hair wet I could not 
Speak and my eyes failed I was neither 
Living nor dead and I knew nothing 
Looking into the heart of light the silence 
Oed und leer das Meer 

Madame Sosostris famous clairvoyante 
Had a bad cold nevertheless 
Is known to be the wisest woman in Europe 
With a wicked pack of cards Here said she 
Is your card the drowned Phoenician Sailor 
Those are pearls that were his eyes Look 
Here is Belladonna the Lady of the Rocks 
The lady of situations 
Here is the man with three staves and here the Wheel 
And here is the oneeyed merchant and this card 
Which is blank is something he carries on his back 
Which I am forbidden to see I do not find 
The Hanged Man Fear death by water 
I see crowds of people walking round in a ring 
Thank you If you see dear Mrs Equitone 
Tell her I bring the horoscope myself 
One must be so careful these days 

 Unreal City 
Under the brown fog of a winter dawn 
A crowd flowed over London Bridge so many 
I had not thought death had undone so many 
Sighs short and infrequent were exhaled 
And each man fixed his eyes before his feet 
Flowed up the hill and down King William Street 
To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours 
With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine 
There I saw one I knew and stopped him crying Stetson 
You who were with me in the ships at Mylae 
That corpse you planted last year in your garden 
Has it begun to sprout Will it bloom this year 
Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed 
Oh keep the Dog far hence thats friend to men 
Or with his nails hell dig it up again 
You hypocrite lecteurmon semblablemon frere

The Chair she sat in like a burnished throne 
Glowed on the marble where the glass 
Held up by standards wrought with fruited vines 
From which a golden Cupidon peeped out 
Another hid his eyes behind his wing 
Doubled the flames of sevenbranched candelabra 
Reflecting light upon the table as 
The glitter of her jewels rose to meet it 
From satin cases poured in rich profusion 
In vials of ivory and coloured glass 
Unstoppered lurked her strange synthetic perfumes 
Unguent powdered or liquidtroubled confused 
And drowned the sense in odours stirred by the air 
That freshened from the window these ascended 
In fattening the prolonged candleflames 
Flung their smoke into the laquearia 
Stirring the pattern on the coffered ceiling 
Huge seawood fed with copper 
Burned green and orange framed by the coloured stone 
In which sad light a carved dolphin swam 
Above the antique mantel was displayed 
As though a window gave upon the sylvan scene 
The change of Philomel by the barbarous king 
So rudely forced yet there the nightingale 
Filled all the desert with inviolable voice 
And still she cried and still the world pursues 
Jug Jug to dirty ears 
And other withered stumps of time 
Were told upon the walls staring forms 
Leaned out leaning hushing the room enclosed 
Footsteps shuffled on the stair 
Under the firelight under the brush her hair 
Spread out in fiery points 
Glowed into words then would be savagely still 

 My nerves are bad tonight Yes bad Stay with me 
Speak to me Why do you never speak Speak 
 What are you thinking of What thinking What 
I never know what you are thinking Think

 I think we are in rats alley 
Where the dead men lost their bones 

 What is that noise 
    The wind under the door 
What is that noise now What is the wind doing 
    Nothing again nothing 
       Do 
You know nothing Do you see nothing Do you remember 
Nothing 

 I remember 
Those are pearls that were his eyes 
Are you alive or not Is there nothing in your head 
  
          But 
O O O O that Shakespeherian Rag 
Its so elegant 
So intelligent 
What shall I do now What shall I do 
I shall rush out as I am and walk the street 
With my hair down so What shall we do tomorrow 
What shall we ever do 
      The hot water at ten 
And if it rains a closed car at four 
And we shall play a game of chess 
Pressing lidless eyes and waiting for a knock upon the door 

 When Lils husband got demobbed I said 
I didnt mince my words I said to her myself 
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME
Now Alberts coming back make yourself a bit smart 
Hell want to know what you done with that money he gave you 
To get yourself some teeth He did I was there 
You have them all out Lil and get a nice set 
He said I swear I cant bear to look at you 
And no more cant I I said and think of poor Albert 
Hes been in the army four years he wants a good time 
And if you dont give it him theres others will I said 
Oh is there she said Something o that I said 
Then Ill know who to thank she said and give me a straight look 
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME
If you dont like it you can get on with it I said
Others can pick and choose if you cant 
But if Albert makes off it wont be for lack of telling 
You ought to be ashamed I said to look so antique 
And her only thirtyone 
I cant help it she said pulling a long face 
Its them pills I took to bring it off she said 
Shes had five already and nearly died of young George 
The chemist said it would be all right but Ive never been the same 
You are a proper fool I said 
Well if Albert wont leave you alone there it is I said 
What you get married for if you dont want children 
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME
Well that Sunday Albert was home they had a hot gammon 
And they asked me in to dinner to get the beauty of it hot 
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME

The Fire Sermon

 The rivers tent is broken the last fingers of leaf 
Clutch and sink into the wet bank The wind 
Crosses the brown land unheard The nymphs are departed 
Sweet Thames run softly till I end my song 
The river bears no empty bottles sandwich papers 
Silk handkerchiefs cardboard boxes cigarette ends 
Or other testimony of summer nights The nymphs are departed 
And their friends the loitering heirs of city directors 
Departed have left no addresses 
By the waters of Leman I sat down and wept 
Sweet Thames run softly till I end my song 
Sweet Thames run softly for I speak not loud or long 
But at my back in a cold blast I hear 
The rattle of the bones and chuckle spread from ear to ear 

A rat crept softly through the vegetation 
Dragging its slimy belly on the bank 
While I was fishing in the dull canal 
On a winter evening round behind the gashouse 
Musing upon the king my brothers wreck 
And on the king my fathers death before him 
White bodies naked on the low damp ground 
And bones cast in a little low dry garret 
Rattled by the rats foot only year to year 
But at my back from time to time I hear 
The sound of horns and motors which shall bring 
Sweeney to Mrs Porter in the spring 
O the moon shone bright on Mrs Porter 
And on her daughter 
They wash their feet in soda water 
Et O ces voix denfants chantant dans la coupole

Unreal City 
Under the brown fog of a winter noon 
Mr Eugenides the Smyrna merchant 
Unshaven with a pocket full of currants 
Cif London documents at sight 
Asked me in demotic French 
To luncheon at the Cannon Street Hotel 
Followed by a weekend at the Metropole 

At the violet hour when the eyes and back 
Turn upward from the desk when the human engine waits 
Like a taxi throbbing waiting 
I Tiresias though blind throbbing between two lives 
Old man with wrinkled female breasts can see 
At the violet hour the evening hour that strives 
Homeward and brings the sailor home from sea 
The typist home at teatime clears her breakfast lights 
Her stove and lays out food in tins 
Out of the window perilously spread 
Her drying combinations touched by the suns last rays 
On the divan are piled at night her bed 
Stockings slippers camisoles and stays 
I Tiresias old man with wrinkled dugs 
Perceived the scene and foretold the rest 
I too awaited the expected guest 
He the young man carbuncular arrives 
A small house agents clerk with one bold stare 
One of the low on whom assurance sits 
As a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire 
The time is now propitious as he guesses 
The meal is ended she is bored and tired 
Endeavours to engage her in caresses 
Which still are unreproved if undesired 
Flushed and decided he assaults at once 
Exploring hands encounter no defence 
His vanity requires no response 
And makes a welcome of indifference 
And I Tiresias have foresuffered all 
Enacted on this same divan or bed 
I who have sat by Thebes below the wall 
And walked among the lowest of the dead 
Bestows one final patronising kiss 
And gropes his way finding the stairs unlit 

She turns and looks a moment in the glass 
Hardly aware of her departed lover 
Her brain allows one halfformed thought to pass 
Well now thats done and Im glad its over
When lovely woman stoops to folly and 
Paces about her room again alone 
She smoothes her hair with automatic hand 
And puts a record on the gramophone 

This music crept by me upon the waters 
And along the Strand up Queen Victoria Street 
O City city I can sometimes hear 
Beside a public bar in Lower Thames Street 
The pleasant whining of a mandoline 
And a clatter and a chatter from within 
Where fishmen lounge at noon where the walls 
Of Magnus Martyr hold 
Inexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold 

The river sweats 
Oil and tar 
The barges drift 
With the turning tide 
Red sails 
Wide 
To leeward swing on the heavy spar 
  The barges wash 
  Drifting logs 
  Down Greenwich reach 
  Past the Isle of Dogs 
     Weialala leia 
     Wallala leialala

  Elizabeth and Leicester 
  Beating oars 
  The stern was formed 
  A gilded shell 
  Red and gold 
  The brisk swell 
  Rippled both shores 
  Southwest wind 
  Carried down stream 
  The peal of bells 
  White towers 
    Weialala leia 
    Wallala leialala 

Trams and dusty trees 
Highbury bore me Richmond and Kew 
Undid me By Richmond I raised my knees 
Supine on the floor of a narrow canoe

My feet are at Moorgate and my heart 
Under my feet After the event 
He wept He promised a new start 
I made no comment What should I resent 

On Margate Sands 
I can connect 
Nothing with nothing 
The broken fingernails of dirty hands 
My people humble people who expect 
Nothing 
   la la 

To Carthage then I came 

Burning burning burning burning 
O Lord Thou pluckest me out 
O Lord Thou pluckest

Death by Water

Phlebas the Phoenician a fortnight dead 
Forgot the cry of gulls and the deep sea swell 
And the profit and loss 
     A current under sea 
Picked his bones in whispers As he rose and fell 
He passed the stages of his age and youth 
Entering the whirlpool 
     Gentile or Jew 
O you who turn the wheel and look to windward 
Consider Phlebas who was once handsome and tall as you 

What the Thunder Said

 After the torchlight red on sweaty faces 
After the frosty silence in the gardens 
After the agony in stony places 
The shouting and the crying 
Prison and palace and reverberation 
Of thunder of spring over distant mountains 
He who was living is now dead 
We who were living are now dying 
With a little patience 

Here is no water but only rock 
Rock and no water and the sandy road 
The road winding above among the mountains 
Which are mountains of rock without water 
If there were water we should stop and drink 
Amongst the rock one cannot stop or think 
Sweat is dry and feet are in the sand 
If there were only water amongst the rock 
Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit 
Here one can neither stand nor lie nor sit 
There is not even silence in the mountains 
But dry sterile thunder without rain 
There is not even solitude in the mountains 
But red sullen faces sneer and snarl 
From doors of mudcracked houses 
     If there were water 
 And no rock 
 If there were rock 
 And also water 
 And water 
 A spring 
 A pool among the rock 
 If there were the sound of water only 
 Not the cicada 
 And dry grass singing 
 But sound of water over a rock 
 Where the hermitthrush sings in the pine trees 
 Drip drop drip drop drop drop drop 
 But there is no water 

Who is the third who walks always beside you 
When I count there are only you and I together 
But when I look ahead up the white road 
There is always another one walking beside you 
Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle hooded 
I do not know whether a man or a woman 
But who is that on the other side of you 

What is that sound high in the air 
Murmur of maternal lamentation 
Who are those hooded hordes swarming 
Over endless plains stumbling in cracked earth 
Ringed by the flat horizon only 
What is the city over the mountains 
Cracks and reforms and bursts in the violet air 
Falling towers 
Jerusalem Athens Alexandria 
Vienna London 
Unreal 

A woman drew her long black hair out tight 
And fiddled whisper music on those strings 
And bats with baby faces in the violet light 
Whistled and beat their wings 
And crawled head downward down a blackened wall 
And upside down in air were towers 
Tolling reminiscent bells that kept the hours 
And voices singing out of empty cisterns and exhausted wells 

In this decayed hole among the mountains 
In the faint moonlight the grass is singing 
Over the tumbled graves about the chapel 
There is the empty chapel only the winds home 
It has no windows and the door swings 
Dry bones can harm no one 
Only a cock stood on the rooftree 
Co co rico co co rico 
In a flash of lightning Then a damp gust 
Bringing rain 

Ganga was sunken and the limp leaves 
Waited for rain while the black clouds 
Gathered far distant over Himavant 
The jungle crouched humped in silence 
Then spoke the thunder 
DA
Datta what have we given 
My friend blood shaking my heart 
The awful daring of a moments surrender 
Which an age of prudence can never retract 
By this and this only we have existed 
Which is not to be found in our obituaries 
Or in memories draped by the beneficent spider 
Or under seals broken by the lean solicitor 
In our empty rooms
DA
Dayadhvam I have heard the key 
Turn in the door once and turn once only 
We think of the key each in his prison 
Thinking of the key each confirms a prison 
Only at nightfall aethereal rumours 
Revive for a moment a broken Coriolanus

Damyata The boat responded 
Gaily to the hand expert with sail and oar 
The sea was calm your heart would have responded 
Gaily when invited beating obedient 
To controlling hands

Fishing with the arid plain behind me 
Shall I at least set my lands in order 
London Bridge is falling down falling down falling down

Let us go then you and I
When the evening is spread out against the sky 
Like a patient etherized upon a table 
Let us go through certain half deserted streets 
The muttering retreats 
Of restless nights in one night cheap hotels 
And sawdust restaurants with oyster shells 
Streets that follow like a tedious argument 
Of insidious intent 
To lead you to an overwhelming question 
Oh do not ask What is it 
Let us go and make our visit 

In the room the women come and go 
Talking of Michelangelo 

The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window panes 
The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window panes 
Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening 
Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains 
Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys 
Slipped by the terrace made a sudden leap 
And seeing that it was a soft October night 
Curled once about the house and fell asleep 

And indeed there will be time 
For the yellow smoke that slides along the street 
Rubbing its back upon the window panes 
There will be time there will be time 
To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet 
There will be time to murder and create 
And time for all the works and days of hands 
That lift and drop a question on your plate 
Time for you and time for me 
And time yet for a hundred indecisions 
And for a hundred visions and revisions 
Before the taking of a toast and tea 

In the room the women come and go 
Talking of Michelangelo 

And indeed there will be time 
To wonder Do I dare and Do I dare 
Time to turn back and descend the stair 
With a bald spot in the middle of my hair 
They will say How his hair is growing thin 
My morning coat my collar mounting firmly to the chin 
My necktie rich and modest but asserted by a simple pin 
They will say But how his arms and legs are thin 
Do I dare 
Disturb the universe 
In a minute there is time 
For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse 

For I have known them all already known them all 
Have known the evenings mornings afternoons 
I have measured out my life with coffee spoons 
I know the voices dying with a dying fall 
Beneath the music from a farther room 
        So how should I presume 

And I have known the eyes already known them all 
The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase 
And when I am formulated sprawling on a pin 
When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall 
Then how should I begin 
To spit out all the butt ends of my days and ways 
        And how should I presume 

And I have known the arms already known them all 
Arms that are braceleted and white and bare 
But in the lamplight downed with light brown hair 
Is it perfume from a dress 
That makes me so digress 
Arms that lie along a table or wrap about a shawl 
        And should I then presume 
        And how should I begin 

Shall I say I have gone at dusk through narrow streets 
And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes 
Of lonely men in shirt sleeves leaning out of windows 

I should have been a pair of ragged claws 
Scuttling across the floors of silent seas 

And the afternoon the evening sleeps so peacefully 
Smoothed by long fingers 
Asleep tired or it malingers 
Stretched on the floor here beside you and me 
Should I after tea and cakes and ices 
Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis 
But though I have wept and fasted wept and prayed 
Though I have seen my head grown slightly bald brought in upon a platter 
I am no prophet and heres no great matter 
I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker 
And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat and snicker 
And in short I was afraid 

And would it have been worth it after all 
After the cups the marmalade the tea 
Among the porcelain among some talk of you and me 
Would it have been worth while 
To have bitten off the matter with a smile 
To have squeezed the universe into a ball 
To roll it towards some overwhelming question 
To say I am Lazarus come from the dead 
Come back to tell you all I shall tell you all 
If one settling a pillow by her head 
        Should say That is not what I meant at all 
        That is not it at all 

And would it have been worth it after all 
Would it have been worth while 
After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets 
After the novels after the teacups after the skirts that trail along the floor 
And this and so much more 
It is impossible to say just what I mean 
But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen 
Would it have been worth while 
If one settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl 
And turning toward the window should say 
        That is not it at all 
        That is not what I meant at all 

No I am not Prince Hamlet nor was meant to be 
Am an attendant lord one that will do 
To swell a progress start a scene or two 
Advise the prince no doubt an easy tool 
Deferential glad to be of use 
Politic cautious and meticulous 
Full of high sentence but a bit obtuse 
At times indeed almost ridiculous 
Almost at times the Fool 

I grow old I grow old 
I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled 

Shall I part my hair behind Do I dare to eat a peach 
I shall wear white flannel trousers and walk upon the beach 
I have heard the mermaids singing each to each 

I do not think that they will sing to me 

I have seen them riding seaward on the waves 
Combing the white hair of the waves blown back 
When the wind blows the water white and black 
We have lingered in the chambers of the sea 
By sea girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown 
Till human voices wake us and we drown

As I walked out one evening
  Walking down Bristol Street
The crowds upon the pavement
  Were fields of harvest wheat

And down by the brimming river
  I heard a lover sing
Under an arch of the railway
  Love has no ending

Ill love you dear Ill love you
  Till China and Africa meet
And the river jumps over the mountain
  And the salmon sing in the street

Ill love you till the ocean
  Is folded and hung up to dry
And the seven stars go squawking
  Like geese about the sky

The years shall run like rabbits
  For in my arms I hold
The Flower of the Ages
  And the first love of the world

But all the clocks in the city
  Began to whirr and chime
O let not Time deceive you
  You cannot conquer Time

In the burrows of the Nightmare
  Where Justice naked is
Time watches from the shadow
  And coughs when you would kiss

In headaches and in worry
  Vaguely life leaks away
And Time will have his fancy
  Tomorrow or today

Into many a green valley
  Drifts the appalling snow
Time breaks the threaded dances
  And the divers brilliant bow

O plunge your hands in water
  Plunge them in up to the wrist
Stare stare in the basin
  And wonder what youve missed

The glacier knocks in the cupboard
  The desert sighs in the bed
And the crack in the tea cup opens
  A lane to the land of the dead

Where the beggars raffle the banknotes
  And the Giant is enchanting to Jack
And the Lily white Boy is a Roarer
  And Jill goes down on her back

O look look in the mirror
  O look in your distress
Life remains a blessing
  Although you cannot bless

O stand stand at the window
  As the tears scald and start
You shall love your crooked neighbour
  With your crooked heart

It was late late in the evening
  The lovers they were gone
The clocks had ceased their chiming
  And the deep river ran on 

I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness starving hysterical naked 
dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix 
angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night 
who poverty and tatters and hollow eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz 
who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated 
who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes hallucinating Arkansas and Blake light tragedy among the scholars of war 
who were expelled from the academies for crazy and publishing obscene odes on the windows of the skull 
who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear burning their money in wastebaskets and listening to the Terror through the wall 
who got busted in their pubic beards returning through Laredo with a belt of marijuana for New York 
who ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in Paradise Alley death or purgatoried their torsos night after night 
with dreams with drugs with waking nightmares alcohol and cock and endless balls 
incomparable blind streets of shuddering cloud and lightning in the mind leaping toward poles of Canada and Paterson illuminating all the motionless world of Time between 
Peyote solidities of halls backyard green tree cemetery dawns wine drunkenness over the rooftops storefront boroughs of teahead joyride neon blinking traffic light sun and moon and tree vibrations in the roaring winter dusks of Brooklyn ashcan rantings and kind king light of mind 
who chained themselves to subways for the endless ride from Battery to holy Bronx on benzedrine until the noise of wheels and children brought them down shuddering mouth wracked and battered bleak of brain all drained of brilliance in the drear light of Zoo 
who sank all night in submarine light of Bickfords floated out and sat through the stale beer afternoon in desolate Fugazzis listening to the crack of doom on the hydrogen jukebox 
who talked continuously seventy hours from park to pad to bar to Bellevue to museum to the Brooklyn Bridge 
a lost battalion of platonic conversationalists jumping down the stoops off fire escapes off windowsills off Empire State out of the moon 
yacketayakking screaming vomiting whispering facts and memories and anecdotes and eyeball kicks and shocks of hospitals and jails and wars 
whole intellects disgorged in total recall for seven days and nights with brilliant eyes meat for the Synagogue cast on the pavement 
who vanished into nowhere Zen New Jersey leaving a trail of ambiguous picture postcards of Atlantic City Hall 
suffering Eastern sweats and Tangerian bone grindings and migraines of China under junk withdrawal in Newarks bleak furnished room  
who wandered around and around at midnight in the railroad yard wondering where to go and went leaving no broken hearts 
who lit cigarettes in boxcars boxcars boxcars racketing through snow toward lonesome farms in grandfather night 
who studied Plotinus Poe St John of the Cross telepathy and bop kabbalah because the cosmos instinctively vibrated at their feet in Kansas  
who loned it through the streets of Idaho seeking visionary indian angels who were visionary indian angels 
who thought they were only mad when Baltimore gleamed in supernatural ecstasy 
who jumped in limousines with the Chinaman of Oklahoma on the impulse of winter midnight streetlight smalltown rain 
who lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex or soup and followed the brilliant Spaniard to converse about America and Eternity a hopeless task and so took ship to Africa 
who disappeared into the volcanoes of Mexico leaving behind nothing but the shadow of dungarees and the lava and ash of poetry scattered in fireplace Chicago 
who reappeared on the West Coast investigating the FBI in beards and shorts with big pacifist eyes sexy in their dark skin passing out incomprehensible leaflets 
who burned cigarette holes in their arms protesting the narcotic tobacco haze of Capitalism 
who distributed Supercommunist pamphlets in Union Square weeping and undressing while the sirens of Los Alamos wailed them down and wailed down Wall and the Staten Island ferry also wailed 
who broke down crying in white gymnasiums naked and trembling before the machinery of other skeletons 
who bit detectives in the neck and shrieked with delight in policecars for committing no crime but their own wild cooking pederasty and intoxication 
who howled on their knees in the subway and were dragged off the roof waving genitals and manuscripts 
who let themselves be fucked in the ass by saintly motorcyclists and screamed with joy 
who blew and were blown by those human seraphim the sailors caresses of Atlantic and Caribbean love 
who balled in the morning in the evenings in rosegardens and the grass of public parks and cemeteries scattering their semen freely to whomever come who may 
who hiccuped endlessly trying to giggle but wound up with a sob behind a partition in a Turkish Bath when the blond and naked angel came to pierce them with a sword 
who lost their loveboys to the three old shrews of fate the one eyed shrew of the heterosexual dollar the one eyed shrew that winks out of the womb and the one eyed shrew that does nothing but sit on her ass and snip the intellectual golden threads of the craftsmans loom 
who copulated ecstatic and insatiate with a bottle of beer a sweetheart a package of cigarettes a candle and fell off the bed and continued along the floor and down the hall and ended fainting on the wall with a vision of ultimate cunt and come eluding the last gyzym of consciousness 
who sweetened the snatches of a million girls trembling in the sunset and were red eyed in the morning but prepared to sweeten the snatch of the sunrise flashing buttocks under barns and naked in the lake 
who went out whoring through Colorado in myriad stolen night cars NC secret hero of these poems cocksman and Adonis of Denver joy to the memory of his innumerable lays of girls in empty lots and diner backyards moviehouses rickety rows on mountaintops in caves or with gaunt waitresses in familiar roadside lonely petticoat upliftings and especially secret gas station solipsisms of johns and hometown alleys too 
who faded out in vast sordid movies were shifted in dreams woke on a sudden Manhattan and picked themselves up out of basements hung over with heartless Tokay and horrors of Third Avenue iron dreams and stumbled to unemployment offices 
who walked all night with their shoes full of blood on the snowbank docks waiting for a door in the East River to open to a room full of steam heat and opium 
who created great suicidal dramas on the apartment cliff banks of the Hudson under the wartime blur floodlight of the moon and their heads shall be crowned with laurel in oblivion 
who ate the lamb stew of the imagination or digested the crab at the muddy bottom of the rivers of Bowery 
who wept at the romance of the streets with their pushcarts full of onions and bad music 
who sat in boxes breathing in the darkness under the bridge and rose up to build harpsichords in their lofts 
who coughed on the sixth floor of Harlem crowned with flame under the tubercular sky surrounded by orange crates of theology 
who scribbled all night rocking and rolling over lofty incantations which in the yellow morning were stanzas of gibberish 
who cooked rotten animals lung heart feet tail borsht and tortillas dreaming of the pure vegetable kingdom 
who plunged themselves under meat trucks looking for an egg 
who threw their watches off the roof to cast their ballot for Eternity outside of Time and alarm clocks fell on their heads every day for the next decade 
who cut their wrists three times successively unsuccessfully gave up and were forced to open antique stores where they thought they were growing old and cried 
who were burned alive in their innocent flannel suits on Madison Avenue amid blasts of leaden verse and the tanked up clatter of the iron regiments of fashion and the nitroglycerine shrieks of the fairies of advertising and the mustard gas of sinister intelligent editors or were run down by the drunken taxicabs of Absolute Reality 
who jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge this actually happened and walked away unknown and forgotten into the ghostly daze of Chinatown soup alleyways and firetrucks not even one free beer 
who sang out of their windows in despair fell out of the subway window jumped in the filthy Passaic leaped on negroes cried all over the street danced on broken wineglasses barefoot smashed phonograph records of nostalgic European 1930s German jazz finished the whiskey and threw up groaning into the bloody toilet moans in their ears and the blast of colossal steamwhistles 
who barreled down the highways of the past journeying to each others hotrod Golgotha jail solitude watch or Birmingham jazz incarnation 
who drove crosscountry seventytwo hours to find out if I had a vision or you had a vision or he had a vision to find out Eternity 
who journeyed to Denver who died in Denver who came back to Denver and waited in vain who watched over Denver and brooded and loned in Denver and finally went away to find out the Time and now Denver is lonesome for her heroes 
who fell on their knees in hopeless cathedrals praying for each others salvation and light and breasts until the soul illuminated its hair for a second 
who crashed through their minds in jail waiting for impossible criminals with golden heads and the charm of reality in their hearts who sang sweet blues to Alcatraz 
who retired to Mexico to cultivate a habit or Rocky Mount to tender Buddha or Tangiers to boys or Southern Pacific to the black locomotive or Harvard to Narcissus to Woodlawn to the daisychain or grave 
who demanded sanity trials accusing the radio of hypnotism and were left with their insanity and their hands and a hung jury 
who threw potato salad at CCNY lecturers on Dadaism and subsequently presented themselves on the granite steps of the madhouse with shaven heads and harlequin speech of suicide demanding instantaneous lobotomy 
and who were given instead the concrete void of insulin Metrazol electricity hydrotherapy psychotherapy occupational therapy pingpong and amnesia 
who in humorless protest overturned only one symbolic pingpong table resting briefly in catatonia 
returning years later truly bald except for a wig of blood and tears and fingers to the visible madman doom of the wards of the madtowns of the East 
Pilgrim States Rocklands and Greystones foetid halls bickering with the echoes of the soul rocking and rolling in the midnight solitude bench dolmen realms of love dream of life a nightmare bodies turned to stone as heavy as the moon 
with mother finally ****** and the last fantastic book flung out of the tenement window and the last door closed at 4 AM and the last telephone slammed at the wall in reply and the last furnished room emptied down to the last piece of mental furniture a yellow paper rose twisted on a wire hanger in the closet and even that imaginary nothing but a hopeful little bit of hallucination 
ah Carl while you are not safe I am not safe and now youre really in the total animal soup of time 
and who therefore ran through the icy streets obsessed with a sudden flash of the alchemy of the use of the ellipsis catalogue a variable measure and the vibrating plane 
who dreamt and made incarnate gaps in Time and Space through images juxtaposed and trapped the archangel of the soul between 2 visual images and joined the elemental verbs and set the noun and dash of consciousness together jumping with sensation of Pater Omnipotens Aeterna Deus 
to recreate the syntax and measure of poor human prose and stand before you speechless and intelligent and shaking with shame rejected yet confessing out the soul to conform to the rhythm of thought in his naked and endless head 
the madman bum and angel beat in Time unknown yet putting down here what might be left to say in time come after death 
and rose reincarnate in the ghostly clothes of jazz in the goldhorn shadow of the band and blew the suffering of Americas naked mind for love into an eli eli lamma lamma sabacthani saxophone cry that shivered the cities down to the last radio 
with the absolute heart of the poem of life butchered out of their own bodies good to eat a thousand years 

What sphinx of cement and aluminum bashed open their skulls and ate up their brains and imagination 
Moloch Solitude Filth Ugliness Ashcans and unobtainable dollars Children screaming under the stairways Boys sobbing in armies Old men weeping in the parks 
Moloch Moloch Nightmare of Moloch Moloch the loveless Mental Moloch Moloch the heavy judger of men 
Moloch the incomprehensible prison Moloch the crossbone soulless jailhouse and Congress of sorrows Moloch whose buildings are judgment Moloch the vast stone of war Moloch the stunned governments 
Moloch whose mind is pure machinery Moloch whose blood is running money Moloch whose fingers are ten armies Moloch whose breast is a cannibal dynamo Moloch whose ear is a smoking tomb 
Moloch whose eyes are a thousand blind windows Moloch whose skyscrapers stand in the long streets like endless Jehovahs Moloch whose factories dream and croak in the fog Moloch whose smoke stacks and antennae crown the cities 
Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen Moloch whose name is the Mind 
Moloch in whom I sit lonely Moloch in whom I dream Angels Crazy in Moloch Cocksucker in Moloch Lacklove and manless in Moloch 
Moloch who entered my soul early Moloch in whom I am a consciousness without a body Moloch who frightened me out of my natural ecstasy Moloch whom I abandon Wake up in Moloch Light streaming out of the sky 
Moloch Moloch Robot apartments invisible suburbs skeleton treasuries blind capitals demonic industries spectral nations invincible madhouses granite cocks monstrous bombs 
They broke their backs lifting Moloch to Heaven Pavements trees radios tons lifting the city to Heaven which exists and is everywhere about us 
Visions omens hallucinations miracles ecstasies gone down the American river 
Dreams adorations illuminations religions the whole boatload of sensitive bullshit 
Breakthroughs over the river flips and crucifixions gone down the flood Highs Epiphanies Despairs Ten years animal screams and suicides Minds New loves Mad generation down on the rocks of Time 
Real holy laughter in the river They saw it all the wild eyes the holy yells They bade farewell They jumped off the roof to solitude waving carrying flowers Down to the river into the street

Haunted Computer Android Pope
One serves data the other hope
The late night ghosts of mans dire needs
Are snacks on which computer feeds
To harvest zeros sum the sums
Knock something wicked ere it comes
And drop dumb evil to its knees
With inked electric snickersnees
 
While Android Pope takes up from there
Where physics stops mid flight mid air
There Papas primed electric mind
Grows faith in countries of the blind
Where mass and gravity bulk huge
Androeda its centrifuge
Or matter dwindles to mere flea
There Android pope makes papal tea
To serve to doubtful Thomas me
And thee and thine and thine and thee
Last suppers his to circuit there
Where physics loses self in air
And man suprised by large or small
Sees naught beyond the two at all
 
That is the moment where well met
Electric Pope Computer fret
Where stuff gives up its ways and means
And emptiness fills in betweens
Where label less the mystery goes
In veils and prides of cosmic snows
Which rationed out by God beyond
Are light year sea and lake and pond
Which shallow are but drowned in deeps
Computer mind that finds and keeps
But cannot answer final thirst
Which egg or chicken arrived first
 
The primal motive hides in stars
Where astronauts in rocket cars
Will never solve it so bright Pope
With fireworks inside for hope
With tapes for tripes AC DC
Speaks metaphors from Galilee
And bakes good bread and serves a wine
That bloods the soul most super fine
And emptiness fills up ith words
Like flocking flights of firebirds
That move and motion merge and mull
So men gone empty now are full
 
So man stands out in ghosting rains
And makes umbrllas with machines
Half satisfied with in betweens
His life twin mysteries given hope
By Ghost Computer Android Pope

This is the beginning 
Almost anything can happen 
This is where you find 
the creation of light a fish wriggling onto land 
the first word of Paradise Lost on an empty page 
Think of an egg the letter A 
a woman ironing on a bare stage 
as the heavy curtain rises 
This is the very beginning 
The first person narrator introduces himself 
tells us about his lineage 
The mezzo soprano stands in the wings 
Here the climbers are studying a map 
or pulling on their long woolen socks 
This is early on years before the Ark dawn 
The profile of an animal is being smeared 
on the wall of a cave 
and you have not yet learned to crawl 
This is the opening the gambit 
a pawn moving forward an inch 
This is your first night with her 
your first night without her 
This is the first part 
where the wheels begin to turn 
where the elevator begins its ascent 
before the doors lurch apart 

This is the middle 
Things have had time to get complicated 
messy really Nothing is simple anymore 
Cities have sprouted up along the rivers 
teeming with people at cross purposes 
a million schemes a million wild looks 
Disappointment unshoulders his knapsack 
here and pitches his ragged tent 
This is the sticky part where the plot congeals 
where the action suddenly reverses 
or swerves off in an outrageous direction 
Here the narrator devotes a long paragraph 
to why Miriam does not want Edwards child 
Someone hides a letter under a pillow 
Here the aria rises to a pitch 
a song of betrayal salted with revenge 
And the climbing party is stuck on a ledge 
halfway up the mountain 
This is the bridge the painful modulation 
This is the thick of things 
So much is crowded into the middle 
the guitars of Spain piles of ripe avocados 
Russian uniforms noisy parties 
lakeside kisses arguments heard through a wall 
too much to name too much to think about 

And this is the end 
the car running out of road 
the river losing its name in an ocean 
the long nose of the photographed horse 
touching the white electronic line 
This is the colophon the last elephant in the parade 
the empty wheelchair 
and pigeons floating down in the evening 
Here the stage is littered with bodies 
the narrator leads the characters to their cells 
and the climbers are in their graves 
It is me hitting the period 
and you closing the book 
It is Sylvia Plath in the kitchen 
and St Clement with an anchor around his neck 
This is the final bit 
thinning away to nothing 
This is the end according to Aristotle 
what we have all been waiting for 
what everything comes down to 
the destination we cannot help imagining 
a streak of light in the sky 
a hat on a peg and outside the cabin falling leaves

Strange memories on this nervous night in Las Vegas Five years later Six It seems like a lifetime or at least a Main Era the kind of peak that never comes again San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of Maybe it meant something Maybe not in the long run but no explanation no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world Whatever it meant

History is hard to know because of all the hired bullshit but even without being sure of history it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the energy of a whole generation comes to a head in a long fine flash for reasons that nobody really understands at the time and which never explain in retrospect what actually happened

My central memory of that time seems to hang on one or five or maybe forty nights or very early mornings when I left the Fillmore half crazy and instead of going home aimed the big 650 Lightning across the Bay Bridge at a hundred miles an hour wearing LL Bean shorts and a Butte sheepherders jacket booming through the Treasure Island tunnel at the lights of Oakland and Berkeley and Richmond not quite sure which turn off to take when I got to the other end always stalling at the toll gate too twisted to find neutral while I fumbled for change but being absolutely certain that no matter which way I went I would come to a place where people were just as high and wild as I was No doubt at all about that

There was madness in any direction at any hour If not across the Bay then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda You could strike sparks anywhere There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right that we were winning

And that I think was the handle that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil Not in any mean or military sense we didnt need that Our energy would simply prevail There was no point in fighting on our side or theirs We had all the momentum we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave

So now less than five years later you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high water mark that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back



The sky calls to us If we do not destroy ourselves we will one day venture to the stars



Ode to Coit Tower

O antiverdurous phallic were it not for your pouring height looming in tears like a sick tree or your ever gaudy comfort jabbing your citys much wrinkled sky you would seem an absurd Babel squatting before mortal millions

Because I filled your dull sockets with my New York City eyes vibrations that had not doomed dumb Empire State did not doom thee

Enough my eyes made you see phantasmal at night mad children of soda caps laying down their abundant blond verse on the gridiron of each others Eucharistic feet like distant kings laying down treasures from camels

Illuminations hinged to masculine limbs fresh with the labor sweat of cablecar and Genoa papa pushcart

Bounty of electricity and visions carpented on pig bastard night in its spore like the dim lights of some hallucinating facade

Ah tower from thy berryless head Id a vision in common with myself the proximity of Alcatraz and not the hip volley of white jazz and verse or verse and jazz embraced but a real heart rending constant vision of Alcatraz marshalled before my eyes

Stocky Alcatraz weeping on Neptunes table whose petrific bondage crushes the dreamless seaharp gasping for song O that that piece of sea fails to dream

Tower Id a verdure vagueness fixed by a green wind the shade of Mercy lashed with cold nails against the wheatweather Western sky weeping Im sure for humanitys vast door to open that all men be free that both hinge and lock die that all doors if they close close like Chinese bells

Was it mans love to screw the sky with monuments span the bay with orange and silver bridges shuttling structure into structure incorruptible in this endless tie each age impassions be it in stone or steel either in echo or half heard ruin

Was it mans love that put that rock there never to avalanche but in vision or this imaginary now or myself standing on Telegraph Hill Nob Hill Russian Hill the same view always Alcatraz like a deserted holiday

And I cried for Alcatraz there in your dumb hollows 0 tower clenching my Pans foot with vivid hoard of Dannemora

Cried for that which was no longer sovereign in me stinking of dead dreams dreams I yet feign to bury thus to shun realitys worm

Dreams that once jumped joyous bright from my heart like sparks issued from a wild sharpers wheel now issued no longer

Weret not for cities or prisons 0 tower I might yet be that verdure monk lulling over green country albums with no greater dream than my youths dream

Eyes of my hands Queen Penthesileia and her tribe Messenger stars Doctor Deformous back from his leprosy and woe Thracian ships Joyprints of pure air

Impossible for me to betray even the simplest tree

Idiotic colossus I came to your city during summer after Cambridge there also no leaf throbbed between my fingers no cool insect thrilled my palm though Id a vision there Death seated like a huge black stove

Inspired by such I came to your city walked Market Street singing hark hark the dogs do bark the beggars are coming to town and ran mad across Golden Gate into Sausalito and fell exhausted in a field where an endless scarecrow lay its head on my lap

How happily mad I was 0 tower lying there amid gossipy green dreaming of Quetzalcoatl as I arched my back like a rainbow over some imaginary gulph

0 for that madness again that infinitive solitude where illusion spoke Truths divine dialect

I should have stayed yet I left to Mexico to Quetzalcoatl and heard there atop Teotihuacan in prophetic voice a dark anthem for the coming year

Ah tower tower that I felt sad for Alcatraz and not for your heroes lessened not the tourist love of my eyes

I saw your blackjacketed saints your Zens potsmokers Athenians and cocksmen

Though the West Wind seemed to harbor there not one
pure Shelleyean dream of lets say hay
like universe
golden heap on a wall of fire
sprinting toward the gauzy eradication of
Swindleresque Ink

The places that we have known belong now only to the little world of space on which
we map them for our own convenience None of them was ever more than a
thin slice held between the contiguous impressions that composed our
life at that time remembrance of a particular form is but regret for a
particular moment and houses roads avenues are as fugitive alas as
the years

In Xanadu did Kubla Khan 
A stately pleasure dome decree 
Where Alph the sacred river ran 
Through caverns measureless to man 
  Down to a sunless sea 
So twice five miles of fertile ground 
With walls and towers were girdled round 
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills 
Where blossomed many an incense bearing tree 
And here were forests ancient as the hills 
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery 

But oh that deep romantic chasm which slanted 
Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover 
A savage place as holy and enchanted 
As ever beneath a waning moon was haunted 
By woman wailing for her demon lover 
And from this chasm with ceaseless turmoil seething 
As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing 
A mighty fountain momently was forced 
Amid whose swift half intermitted burst 
Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail 
Or chaffy grain beneath the threshers flail 
And mid these dancing rocks at once and ever 
It flung up momently the sacred river 
Five miles meandering with a mazy motion 
Through wood and dale the sacred river ran 
Then reached the caverns measureless to man 
And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean 
And amid this tumult Kubla heard from far 
Ancestral voices prophesying war 
  The shadow of the dome of pleasure 
  Floated midway on the waves 
  Where was heard the mingled measure 
  From the fountain and the caves 
It was a miracle of rare device 
A sunny pleasure dome with caves of ice 

  A damsel with a dulcimer 
  In a vision once I saw 
  It was an Abyssinian maid 
  And on her dulcimer she played 
  Singing of Mount Abora 
  Could I revive within me 
  Her symphony and song 
  To such a deep delight would win me 
That with music loud and long 
I would build that dome in air 
That sunny dome those caves of ice 
And all who heard should see them there 
And all should cry Beware Beware 
His flashing eyes his floating hair 
Weave a circle round him thrice 
And close your eyes with holy dread 
For he on honey dew hath fed 
And drunk the milk of Paradise

When a child first catches adults out when it first walks into his grave little head that adults do not always have divine intelligence that their judgments are not always wise their thinking true their sentences just his world falls into panic desolation The gods are fallen and all safety gone And there is one sure thing about the fall of gods they do not fall a little they crash and shatter or sink deeply into green muck It is a tedious job to build them up again they never quite shine And the child’s world is never quite whole again It is an aching kind of growing

The most merciful thing in the world I think is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity and it was not meant that we should voyage far The sciences each straining in its own direction have hitherto harmed us little but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality and of our frightful position therein that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age

We believe that we can change the things around us in accordance with our desires we believe it because otherwise we can see no favourable outcome We do not think of the outcome which generally comes to pass and is also favourable we do not succeed in changing things in accordance with our desires but gradually our desires change The situation that we hoped to change because it was intolerable becomes unimportant to us We have failed to surmount the obstacle as we were absolutely determined to do but life has taken us round it led us beyond it and then if we turn round to gaze into the distance of the past we can barely see it so imperceptible has it become

I must not fear Fear is the mind killer Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration I will face my fear I will permit it to pass over me and through me And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path Where the fear has gone there will be nothing Only I will remain

If people bring so much courage to this world the world has to kill them to break them so of course it kills them The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the broken places But those that will not break it kills It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry

Then they went into the room shook him as hard as they could shouted in his ear put a mirror in front of his nostrils but they could not awaken him A short time later when the carpenter was taking measurements for the coffin through the window they saw a light rain of tiny yellow flowers falling They fell on the town all through the night in a silent storm and they covered the roofs and blocked the doors and smothered the animals who slept outdoors So many flowers fell from the sky that in the morning the streets were carpeted with a compact cushion and they had to clear them away with shovels and rakes so that the funeral procession could pass by

We are all dying to give our lives away to something maybe God or Satan politics or grammar topology or philately the object seemed incidental to this will to give ourselves away utterly To games or needles to some other person Something pathetic about it A flight from in the form of a plunging into Flight from exactly what These rooms blandly filled with excrement and heat To what purpose

and then youre in serious trouble very serious trouble and you know it finally deadly serious trouble because this Substance you thought was your one true friend that you gave up all for gladly that for so long gave you relief from the pain of the Losses your love of that relief caused your mother and lover and god and compadre has finally removed its smily face mask to reveal centerless eyes and a ravening maw and canines down to here its the Face In The Floor the grinning root white face of your worst nightmares and the face is your own face in the mirror now its you the Substance has devoured or replaced and become you and the puke drool and Substance crusted shirt you have both worn for weeks now gets torn off and you stand there looking and in the root white chest where your heart (given away to It) should be beating in its exposed chests center and centerless eyes is just a lightless hole more teeth and a beckoning taloned hand dangling something irresistible and now you see youve been had screwed royal stripped and fucked and tossed to the side like some stuffed toy to lie for all time in the posture you land in You see now that Its your enemy and your worst personal nightmare and the trouble Its gotten you into is undeniable and you still cant stop Doing the Substance now is like attending Black Mass but you still cant stop even though the Substance no longer gets you high You are as they say Finished You cannot get drunk and you cannot get sober you cannot get high and you cannot get straight You are behind bars you are in a cage and can see only bars in every direction You are in the kind of a hell of a mess that either ends lives or turns them around

That dead eyed anhedonia is but a remora on the ventral flank of the true predator the Great White Shark of pain Authorities term this condition clinical depression or involutional depression or unipolar dysphoria Instead of just an incapacity for feeling a deadening of soul the predator grade depression Kate Gompert always feels as she Withdraws from secret marijuana is itself a feeling It goes by many names anguish despair torment or melancholia or more authoritative psychotic depression but Kate Gompert down in the trenches with the thing itself knows it simply as It

It is a level of psychic pain wholly incompatible with human life as we know it It is a sense of radical and thoroughgoing evil not just as a feature but as the essence of conscious existence It is a sense of poisoning that pervades the self at the selfs most elementary levels It is a nausea of the cells and soul It is an unnumb intuition in which the world is fully rich and animate and un map like and also thoroughly painful and malignant and antagonistic to the self which depressed self It billows on and coagulates around and wraps in Its black folds and absorbs into Itself so that an almost mystical unity is achieved with a world every constituent of which means painful harm to the self Its emotional character the feeling Gompert describes It as is probably mostly indescribable except as a sort of double bind in which any of the alternatives we associate with human agency sitting or standing doing or resting speaking or keeping silent living or dying are not just unpleasant but literally horrible

It is also lonely on a level that cannot be conveyed There is no way Kate Gompert could ever even begin to make someone else understand what clinical depression feels like not even another person who is herself clinically depressed because a person in such a state is incapable of empathy with any other living thing This anhedonic Inability To Identify is also an integral part of It If a person in physical pain has a hard time attending to anything except that pain a clinically depressed person cannot even perceive any other person or thing as independent of the universal pain that is digesting her cell by cell Everything is part of the problem and there is no solution It is a hell for one

The authoritative term psychotic depression makes Kate Gompert feel especially lonely Specifically the psychotic part Think of it this way Two people are screaming in pain One of them is being tortured with electric current The other is not The screamer whos being tortured with electric current is not psychotic her screams are circumstantially appropriate The screaming person whos not being tortured however is psychotic since the outside parties making the diagnoses can see no electrodes or measurable amperage One of the least pleasant things about being psychotically depressed on a ward full of psychotically depressed patients is coming to see that none of them is really psychotic that their screams are entirely appropriate to certain circumstances part of whose special charm is that they are undetectable by any outside party Thus the loneliness its a closed circuit the current is both applied and received from within

Mankind flung its advance agents ever outward ever outward Eventually it flung them out into space into the colorless tasteless weightless sea of outwardness without end It flung them like stones

I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes

Her antiquity in preceding and surviving succeeding tellurian generations her nocturnal predominance her satellitic dependence her luminary reflection her constancy under all her phases rising and setting by her appointed times waxing and waning the forced invariability of her aspect her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation her potency over effluent and refluent waters her power to enamour to mortify to invest with beauty to render insane to incite to and aid delinquency the tranquil inscrutability of her visage the terribility of her isolated dominant resplendent propinquity her omens of tempest and of calm the stimulation of her light her motion and her presence the admonition of her craters her arid seas her silence her splendour when visible her attraction when invisible

It soared a bird it held its flight a swift pure cry soar silver orb it leaped serene speeding sustained to come dont spin it out too long long breath he breath long life soaring high high resplendent aflame crowned high in the effulgence symbolistic high of the ethereal bosom high of the high vast irradiation everywhere all soaring all around about the all the endlessness

Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall She thought she understood She would try to understand him because men were so different The old love was waiting waiting with little white hands stretched out with blue appealing eyes Heart of mine She would follow her dream of love the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide Come what might she would be wild untrammelled free

In womans womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away This is the postcreation

The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence silence that is infinite of space and swiftly silently the sound is wafted over regions of cycles of cycles of generations that have lived

If he had smiled why would he have smiled To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if the first term of a succeeding one each imagining himself to be first last only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor alone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity

I wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you I love flowers Id love to have the whole place swimming in roses God of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will yes

His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent ending Why not endless till the farthest star Darkly they are there behind this light darkness shining in the brightness delta of Cassiopeia worlds Me sits there with his augurs rod of ash in borrowed sandals by day beside a livid sea unbeheld in violet nigh walking beneath a reign of uncouth stars I throw this ended shadow from me manshape ineluctable call it back Endless would it be mine form of my form Who watches me here Who ever anywhere will read these written words

He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full naked in a womb of warmth oiled by scented melting soap softly laved He saw his trunk and limbs rip rippled over and sustained buoyed lightly upward lemon yellow his navel bud of flesh and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush floating floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands a languid floating flower

Ugly and futile lean neck and thick hair and a stain of ink a snail’s bed Yet someone had loved him borne him in her arms and in her heart But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot a squashed boneless snail She had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own Was that then real The only true thing in life His mother’s prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal bestrode She was no more the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes She had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone scarcely having been A poor soul gone to heaven and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox red reek of rapine in his fur with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth listened scraped up the earth listened scraped and scraped

Look again at that pale blue dot Thats here Thats home Thats us On it everyone you love everyone you know everyone you ever heard of every human being who ever was lived out their lives The aggregate of our joy and suffering thousands of confident religions ideologies and economic doctrines every hunter and forager every hero and coward every creator and destroyer of civilization every king and peasant every young couple in love every mother and father hopeful child inventor and explorer every teacher of morals every corrupt politician every superstar every supreme leader every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam

The sky above the port was the color of television tuned to a dead channel

I woke up as the sun was reddening and that was the one distinct time in my life the strangest moment of all when I didnt know who I was I was far away from home haunted and tired with travel in a cheap hotel room Id never seen hearing the hiss of steam outside and the creak of the old wood of the hotel and footsteps upstairs and all the sad sounds and I looked at the cracked high ceiling and really didnt know who I was for about fifteen strange seconds I wasnt scared I was just somebody else some stranger and my whole life was a haunted life the life of a ghost

the only people for me are the mad ones the ones who are mad to live mad to talk mad to be saved desirous of everything at the same time the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing but burn burn burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the star and in the middle you see the blue centerlight pop

So in America when the sun goes down and I sit on the old broken down river pier watching the long long skies over New Jersey and sense all that raw land that rolls in one unbelievable huge bulge over to the West Coast and all that road going and all the people dreaming in the immensity of it and in Iowa I know by now the children must be crying in the land where they let the children cry and tonight the starsll be out and dont you know that God is the evening star must be drooping and shedding her sparkler dims on the prairie which is just before the coming of complete night that blesses the earth darkens all the rivers cups the peaks and folds the final shore in and nobody nobody knows whats going to happen to anybody besides the forlorn rags of growing old

And for just a moment I had reached the point of ecstasy that I always wanted to reach which was the complete step across chronological time into timeless shadows and wonderment in the bleakness of the mortal realm and the sensation of death kicking at my heels to move on with a phantom dogging its own heels and myself hurrying to a plank where all the angels dove off and flew into the holy void of uncreated emptiness the potent and inconceivable radiancies shining in bright Mind Essence innumerable lotus lands falling open in the magic moths warm of heaven I could hear an indescribable seething roar which wasnt in my ear but everywhere and had nothing to do with sounds I realized that I had died and been reborn numberless times but just didnt remember especially because the transitions from life to death and back to life are so ghostly easy a magical action for naught like falling asleep and waking up again a million times the utter casualness and deep ignorance of it I realized it was only because of the stability of the intrinsic Mind that these ripples of birth and death took place like the action of the wind on a sheet of pure serene mirror like water I felt sweet swinging bliss like a big shot of heroin in the mainline vein like a gulp of wine late in the afternoon and it makes you shudder my feet tingled I thought I was going to die the very next moment But I didnt die

I have lots of things to teach you now in case we ever meet concerning the message that was transmitted to me under a pine tree in North Carolina on a cold winter moonlit night It said that Nothing Ever Happened so dont worry Its all like a dream Everything is ecstasy inside We just dont know it because of our thinking minds But in our true blissful essence of mind is known that everything is alright forever and forever and forever Close your eyes let your hands and nerve ends drop stop breathing for three seconds listen to the silence inside the illusion of the world and you will remember the lesson you forgot which was taught in immense milky way soft cloud innumerable worlds long ago and not even at all It is all one vast awakened thing I call it the golden eternity It is perfect We were never really born we will never really die It has nothing to do with the imaginary idea of a personal self other selves many selves everywhere Self is only an idea a mortal idea That which passes into everything is one thing Its a dream already ended Theres nothing to be afraid of and nothing to be glad about I know this from staring at mountains months on end They never show any expression they are like empty space Do you think the emptiness of space will ever crumble away Mountains will crumble but the emptiness of space which is the one universal essence of mind the vast awakener empty and awake will never crumble away because it was never born

I felt like lying down by the side of the trail and remembering it all The woods do that to you they always look familiar long lost like the face of a long dead relative like an old dream like a piece of forgotten song drifting across the water most of all like golden eternities of past childhood or past manhood and all the living and the dying and the heartbreak that went on a million years ago and the clouds as they pass overhead seem to testify by their own lonesome familiarity to this feeling

Books are finite sexual encounters are finite but the desire to read and to fuck is infinite it surpasses our own deaths our fears our hopes for peace

Reading is like thinking like praying like talking to a friend like expressing your ideas like listening to other peoples ideas like listening to music like looking at the view like taking a walk on the beach

What twisted people we are How simple we seem or at least pretend to be in front of others and how twisted we are deep down How paltry we are and how spectacularly we contort ourselves before our own eyes and the eyes of others And all for what To hide what To make people believe what

The pain or the memory of pain that here was literally sucked away by something nameless until only a void was left The knowledge that this question was possible pain that turns finally into emptiness The knowledge that the same equation applied to everything more or less

I steal into their dreams he said I steal into their most shameful thoughts Im in every shiver every spasm of their souls I steal into their hearts I scrutinize their most fundamental beliefs I scan their irrational impulses their unspeakable emotions I sleep in their lungs during the summer and their muscles during the winter and all of this I do without the least effort without intending to without asking or seeking it out without constraints driven only by love and devotion

The diseased anyway are more interesting than the healthy The words of the diseased even those who can manage only a murmur carry more weight than those of the healthy Then too all healthy people will in the future know disease That sense of time ah the diseased man’s sense of time what treasure hidden in a desert cave Then too the diseased truly bite whereas the healthy pretend to bite but really only snap at the air Then too then too then too

Still American television is full of smiles and more and more perfect looking teeth Do these people want us to trust them No Do they want us to think theyre good people No again The truth is they dont want anything from us They just want to show us their teeth their smiles and admiration is all they want in return Admiration They want us to look at them thats all Their perfect teeth their perfect bodies their perfect manners as if they were constantly breaking away from the sun and they were little pieces of fire little pieces of blazing hell here on this planet simply to be worshipped

The future is there looking back at us Trying to make sense of the fiction we will have become

Cyberspace A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators in every nation by children being taught mathematical concepts A graphic representation of data abstracted from banks of every computer in the human system Unthinkable complexity Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind clusters and constellations of data Like city lights receding

Along the shore the cloud waves break
The twin suns sink beneath the lake
The shadows lengthen
In Carcosa

Strange is the night where black stars rise
And strange moons circle through the skies
But stranger still is
Lost Carcosa

Songs that the Hyades shall sing
Where flap the tatters of the King
Must die unheard in
Dim Carcosa

Song of my soul my voice is dead
Die thou unsung as tears unshed
Shall dry and die in
Lost Carcosa

This is the thing that troubles me for I cannot forget Carcosa where black stars hang in the heavens where the shadows of mens thoughts lengthen in the afternoon when the twin suns sink into the lake of Hali and my mind will bear for ever the memory of the Pallid Mask I pray God will curse the writer as the writer has cursed the world with its beautiful stupendous creation terrible in its simplicity irresistible in its truth a world which now trembles before the King In Yellow

It is well known how the book spread like an infectious disease from city to city from continent to continent barred out here confiscated there denounced by press and pulpit censured even by the most advanced of literary anarchists No definite principles had been violated in those wicked pages no doctrine promulgated no convictions outraged It could not be judged by any known standard yet although it was acknowledged that the supreme note of art had been struck in The King in Yellow all felt that human nature could not bear the strain nor thrive on words in which the essence of purest poison lurked The very banality and innocence of the first act only allowed the blow to fall afterwards with more awful effect

Shall I tell you all about her cat She is very beautiful your mistress he murmured drowsily and her hair is heavy as burnished gold I could paint her not on canvas for I should need shades and tones and hues and dyes more splendid than the iris of a splendid rainbow I could only paint her with closed eyes for in dreams alone can such colors as I need be found For her eyes I must have azure from skies untroubled by a cloud the skies of dreamland For her lips roses from the palaces of slumberland and for her brow snow drifts from mountains which tower in fantastic pinnacles to the moons oh much higher than our moon here” 

I have seen the dark universe yawning
Where the black planets roll without aim
Where they roll in their horror unheeded
Without knowledge or lustre or name

The most merciful thing in the world I think is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity and it was not meant that we should voyage far The sciences each straining in its own direction have hitherto harmed us little but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality and of our frightful position therein that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age

There came to that room wild streams of violet midnight glittering with dust of gold vortices of dust and fire swirling out of the ultimate spaces and heavy perfumes from beyond the worlds Opiate oceans poured there litten by suns that the eye may never behold and having in their whirlpools strange dolphins and sea nymphs of unrememberable depths Noiseless infinity eddied around the dreamer and wafted him away without touching the body that leaned stiffly from the lonely window and for days not counted in calandars of men the tides of far spheres that bore him gently to join the course of other cycles that tenderly left him sleeping on a green sunrise shore a green shore fragrant with lotus blossums and starred by red camalates

But more wonderful than the lore of old men and the lore of books is the secret lore of ocean Blue green grey white or black smooth ruffled or mountainous that ocean is not silent All my days have I watched it and listened to it and I know it well At first it told to me only the plain little tales of calm beaches and near ports but with the years it grew more friendly and spoke of other things of things more strange and more distant in space and in time Sometimes at twilight the grey vapours of the horizon have parted to grant me glimpses of the ways beyond and sometimes at night the deep waters of the sea have grown clear and phosphorescent to grant me glimpses of the ways beneath And these glimpses have been as often of the ways that were and the ways that might be as of the ways that are for ocean is more ancient than the mountains and freighted with the memories and the dreams of Time

The sea can bind us to her many moods whispering to us by the subtle token of a shadow or a gleam upon the waves and hinting in these ways of her mournfulness or rejoicing Always she is remembering old things and these memories though we may not grasp them are imparted to us so that we share her gaiety or remorse

My searchlight expired but still I ran I heard voices and yowls and echoes but above all there gently rose that impious insidious scurrying gently rising rising as a stiff bloated corpse gently rises above an oily river that flows under endless onyx bridges to a black putrid sea Something bumped into me   something soft and plump It must have been the rats the viscous gelatinous ravenous army that feast on the dead and the living

Certainly the terror of a deserted house swells in geometrical rather than arithmetical progression as houses multiply to form a city of stark desolation The sight of such endless avenues of fishy eyed vacancy and death and the thought of such linked infinities of black brooding compartments given over to cob webs and memories and the conqueror worm start up vestigial fears and aversions that not even the stoutest philosophy can disperse

Through the ghoul guarded gateways of slumber
Past the wan mooned abysses of night
I have lived over my lives without number
I have sounded all things with my sight
And I struggle and shriek ere the daybreak being driven to madness with fright

I have whirled with the earth at the dawning
When the sky was a vaporous flame
I have seen the dark universe yawning
Where the black planets roll without aim
Where they roll in their horror unheeded without knowledge or luster or name

I had drifted over seas without ending
Under sinister grey clouded skies
That the many forked lightning is rending
That resound with hysterical cries
With the moans of invisible daemons that out of the green waters rise

I have plunged like a deer through the arches
Of the hoary primordial grove
Where the oaks feel the presence that marches
And stalks on where no spirit dares rove
And I flee from a thing that surrounds me and leers through dead branches above

I have stumbled by cave ridden mountains
That rise barren and bleak from the plain
I have drunk of the fog fetid fountains
That ooze down to the marsh and the main
And in hot cursed tarns I have seen things I care not to gaze on again

I have scanned the vast ivy clad palace
I have trod its untenanted hall
Where the moon rising up from the valleys
Shows the tapestried things on the wall
Strange figures discordantly woven that I cannot endure to recall

I have peered from the casements in wonder
At the mouldering meadows around
At the many roofed village laid under
The curse of a grave girdled ground
And from rows of white urn carven marble I listen intently for sound

I have haunted the tombs of the ages
I have flown on the pinions of fear
Where the smoke belching Erebus rages
Where they loom snow clad and drear
And in realms where the sun of the desert consumes what it never can cheer

I was old when the pharaohs first mounted
The jewel decked throne by the Nile
I was old in those epochs uncounted
When I and I only was vile
And Man yet untainted and happy dwelt in bliss on the far Arctic isle

Oh great was the sin of my spirit
And great is the reach of its doom
Not the pity of Heaven can cheer it
Nor can respite be found in the tomb
Down the infinite eons come beating the wings of unmerciful gloom

Through the ghoul guarded gateways of slumber
Past the wan mooned abysses of night
I have lived over my lives without number
I have sounded all things with my sight
And I struggle and shriek come the daybreak being driven to madness with fright


Take this kiss upon the brow
And in parting from you now
Thus much let me avow
You are not wrong who deem
That my days have been a dream
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night or in a day
In a vision or in none
Is it therefore the less gone 
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream

I stand amid the roar
Of a surf-tormented shore
And I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand
How few yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep
While I weep while I weep
O God Can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp
O God can I not save
One from the pitiless wave
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream
