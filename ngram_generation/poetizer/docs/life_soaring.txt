LIFE SOARING
high high splendiferous aflame crowned high in
the cupboard the desert consumes what it
never can cheer i was a miracle
of rare device a cheery pleasure dome
with caves of ice and all the wild eyes the
holy cry they bade farewell they jumped off
the roof to cast their vote for eternity

VIOLATED IN
those epochs uncounted when i got to
the starry dynamo in the mind clusters
and configuration of data like city
lights receding along the floor and down
by the side of you what is that sound high
in the root white face of a million years
ago and the dead april is the thing

GROVE WHERE
the glass held up by criterion wrought with vines
from which a minute will reverse for i
speak not tacky or long but at my back in
a sunbeam the sky like a gulp of wine
late in the chambers of the human mind
to correlate all its substance we live
on a sheet of pure air impossible
