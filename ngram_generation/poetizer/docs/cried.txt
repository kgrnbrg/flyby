The last time I cried was when I stepped on a nail six months ago. It went all the way through my foot, and that really hurt. I cried for hours.
I cried just the other day. I was reading a book, a comedy, and I was laughing at how perfectly the author described humanities' tendency to exploit certain segments of itself. I was then immediately struck with the sadness of that fact. So many problems in the world, with all of the resources and knowledge to fix those problems, but yet we don't. Makes a man want to cry. 
Last time I cried was at my uncles funeral
I was watching Miyazaki's last film "The Wind Rises" and there was a bittersweet scene in which the protagonist elopes with his terminally ill girlfriend. It was beautifully animated and really touched me, maybe because it made me think about my ex-girlfriend whom I broke up with when I left my hometown to move to NYC for ITP. The devotion of the movie's protagonist to his love across time, hardship, and geography was everything I wasn't willing to do, so seeing this scene made me feel a bit ashamed of myself for not being able to do that for a person I really cared about.
I was in and out of the hospital a lot this past summer. One night at home in July, while I sat on the edge of my bed taking off my shoes following a particularly unkind visit to the doctor, I had a short breakdown and cried. The constant physical and emotional duress of the past few weeks had finally caught up to me. And, I think I was, in some way, mourning what I had lost this summer, and what I was likely to continue losing down the line.
