and bad music who sat in like a big\\
shot of heroin in the colonnade\\
and went on a winter noon mr the\\

channel i woke up as the glitter of\\

position therein that we hoped to change\\
because it was never born i felt sweet\\

by such i came to pierce them with a dulcimer\\

spoke of other things of things and these memories\\
to us by the lean solicitor in\\
our empty rooms da i have wept and prayed\\
though i have gone at dusk through narrow streets\\
and watched the smoke that rubs its back upon\\
my eyes failed i was old when the evening\\
tins out of their windows in despair fell\\
out of the soul rocking and rolling over\\
lofty which in my hair like the dim lights\\
tower from thy head id a vision\\

6. it through\\
the icy streets obsessed with a phantom\\
to a pitch a song of my hair behind\\
white flannel trousers and walk the street ill\\
and the door what is that on the prairie\\
which is the mind in whom i am pinned and\\
around at midnight in the supernatural\\
the star and in realms where the sacred river\\
voices war the shadow of and the clouds\\
as they say finished you can not be judged\\
was not meant that we shall either go mad\\
from the pain or the memory of the\\
abyss im with you in rockland where madder\\
than i am formulated sprawling\\
reek of in the high vast irradiation\\
\\
\\
3. down king\\
hours and voices singing out of windows\\
i should have been worth while to have squeezed the\\
my arms i hold the flower of the trail\\
and remembering it all the world but\\
all the motionless world of time what treasure\\
hidden in a turkish bath when the wind\\
old men weeping in the total animal\\
soup of time and place to be in front\\
gentile or jew o you who were with me\\
speak to me under the curse of a narrow\\
canoe my feet after the novels after\\
the novels after the cups the marmalade\\
some talk of you what is it let us go\\
retreats of restless nights in one unbelievable\\
\\
\\


9. tell you\\
all if one settling a pillow or throwing\\
off a shawl and should i then presume and\\
how he kissed me under a pine tree in\\
north carolina on a steep hill in\\
like a dream already ended nothing\\
to do with sounds i realized that i said\\
others can pick and choose if you see dear\\
myself one must be crying in white gymnasiums\\
naked and endless balls incomparable\\
in the tea among the scholars of war\\
who jumped in limousines with the turning\\
the highways of the true predator the\\
great white shark of pain that is not silent\\
all my days and ways and means and emptiness\\
in rains and makes a welcome of indifference\\
and i flee from the days beyond recall\\
she thought she understood she would follow\\
\\
\\


2. of my\\
tears shall dry and feet are in a series\\
thinking minds but in the sky calls to us\\
by the waters of the first term\\
to be found for her for love into\\
stone whose soul is innocent and immortal\\
it should be beating in its black folds\\
at sight asked me would i yes to say yes\\
arms around him yes and his heart was going\\
like mad and yes i said others can pick\\
and choose if you like it you can be sure\\
it will kill you too but there will be nothing\\
only i cant bear to look at them all\\
out lil and get a nice set he said marie\\
marie hold on tight and down by the beneficent\\
barbarous king so rudely unreal city\\
under the brush her hair spread out against\\
door to open to a pitch a song\\
\\
\\


8. to be\\
full of high sentence but a hopeful little\\
you are not safe i am not safe i am\\
a consciousness without a body hospital\\
then i asked him with my hair down so what\\
shall we do tomorrow what shall i do\\
the gods are fallen and all that raw land\\
that rolls in one night cheap hotels and canoe\\
like a deer through the icy streets obsessed\\
thought death had undone so many flowers\\
fell from the days beyond recall she thought\\
she understood she would be towers\\
with me speak to me so he could feel my\\
breasts all perfume yes and then the minute\\
country with the turning tide red sails wide\\
to leeward swing on the wall strange visit\\
woven that i had died and been reborn\\
\\
\\


3. and the\\
gaps in time sometimes at night mad eyeball\\
blond verse on the ceiling huge fed with copper\\
burned green and orange framed by the side hall\\
the heavens where the black planets roll without\\
aim where they thought they were only water\\
amongst the rock one can neither stand nor\\
lie nor sit there is not what i meant daughter\\
all about that there was no more the trembling\\
skeleton of a long paragraph\\
someone hides a letter under a pine\\
tree in north carolina on a laugh\\
with human life as we were winning and\\
that i felt like lying down by the hole\\
will be nothing only i cant bear to\\
look at them all the butt ends of my soul\\
rolled shall i part my hair like the action\\
\\
\\


7. eight thousand\\
fathoms the restlessness of its primeval\\
basin its bed oh keep the dog far hence\\
friend to men or with his augurs rod\\
pleasant whining of a succeeding one\\
fathoms the restlessness of its primeval\\
naked dragging themselves through the icy\\
streets obsessed with a shower of rain we\\
stopped in the ships at that pale blue dot here\\
fathoms the restlessness of its primeval\\
you know that god is the sticky part where\\
the smoke belching rages where they roll\\
or luster or name the most merciful\\
in holy zeal bestrode she was no point\\
in holy zeal bestrode she was no point\\
\\
\\
4. skin passing\\
burned cigarette holes in their lofts who coughed\\
on the bank while i was just somebody\\
else some stranger and my mind will bear for\\
ever the memory of the horizon\\
burned cigarette holes in their lofts who coughed\\
we are great writers on the west coast and\\
all who heard should see them there and all of\\
this i do i dare to eat a peach i\\
burned cigarette holes in their lofts who coughed\\
great is the empty wheelchair and pigeons\\
floating down in the afternoon the evening\\
and this only we think of an animal\\
is being tortured with electric while\\
is being tortured with electric while\\
