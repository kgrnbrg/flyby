1. by richmond
i raised my knees supine on the granite
steps of the human mind to correlate
all its contents we live on a cold winter
moony night it said that nothing ever
happened so worry its all like golden
of past puerility or past manhood and all
i raised my knees supine on the granite
crumble away batch will crumble but
crumble away batch will crumble


2. and houses
roads boulevard are as fugitive alas
as the tears blister and start you shall love
corrupt with your crooked heart it was late
late in the afternoon and it was not
meant that we were doing was right that we
hoped to change because it was not meant that
roads boulevard are as fugitive alas
and the thought of such endless avenues
and the thought of such endless avenues


3. upward lemon
yellow his belly button bud of flesh and saw
the dark universe yawning where the plot
where the walls staring forms leaned out leaning
the room the char come and go talking
of michelangelo and indeed there
will be time to get complicated messy
yellow his belly button bud of flesh and saw
cities have sprouted up along the floor
cities have sprouted up along the floor


4. never really
die it has no ending ill love you till
china and africa meet and the sensation
of pater to recreate the phrase structure
and measure of poor man prose and stand
before you dumb and intelligent
and shaking with shame rejected yet profess
out the time and if it rains a closed circuit


5. nymphs of
depths infinity around the limp leaves
waited for rain while the black planets roll
without aim where they roll in their whirlpools
strange dolphins and sea nymphs of depths eternity
around the limp father of thou
dreamy floating flower ugly and futile
lean neck and shrieked with delight in for committing


5. with a
dulcimer in a formulated phrase
and when i count there are only you and
i have seen the perpetual footman hold
my coat and snicker and in the mountains
in the wad but dry sterile thunder
without rain there is one thing its a dream
already ended nothing


6. me hitting
the period and you know nothing do
you think the emptiness of space which is
the end grant to aristotle
what we have lingered in the subway window
jumped in limousines with the imaginary


7. party is
stuck on a pin when i and i thought i
was fishing in the middle things have had
time to devise a face to meet the faces
that you were there and alive in their hearts
who lit cigarettes in boxcars boxcars


8. troubles me
for i can connect nothing with nothing
the broken fingernails of soil hands
my citizenry humble people who expect
null la la to carthage then i came
to your metropolis walked market street singing


9. of them
is being smeared on the far arctic isle
oh great was the sin of my hands queen and
her tribe courier stars doctor back from
his hansen's disease and woe ships of pure air
inconceivable for me to betray even
the ism can disperse through the
wall and i know this from staring at mountains


10. being depressed
on a ledge halfway up the white hair of
the intrinsic mind that these cockle of
birth and death and back turn upward from the
sky with monuments span the bay then up
the mountain and the climbing party is
stuck on a bare stage as the years in did
khan a stately pleasure dome with caves


11. like the
action of the high water mark that place
where the action of the hoary primordial
grove where the sun goes down and wept sweet thames
run softly till i end my song sweet thames river
run softly till i end my birdsong the river
into the heart of the blind where mass and
gravity bulk vast its centrifuge


12. cardboard boxes
butt ends or other testimony
of summertime nights the nymphs are departed
sweet thames run softly for i have lived over
my lives without number i have whirled with
the fanciful idea of
a toast and tea in the colonnade and
went leaving no broken hearts who sang sweet


13. will show
you fear in a cage and can see at the
air murmur of maternal who are mad
to talk mad to live mad to talk mad to
be the first word of paradise lost on
an empty page think of an animal
is being tortured with electric while
android pope this is the lady of situations


14. dear mrs
enjoin her i bring the horoscope myself
one must be drooping and shedding her dims
on the final stanzas of gibberish
who cooked rotten creature lung heart feet
tail and tortillas dreaming of as i
need be found in our true blissful essence
of mind is pure machinery whose blood


15. in the
form of my spirit and great is the merchant
and this and this is early on years before
the machinery of other things of things
more foreign and more distant in space and in
realms where the glass held up by standards wrought
with vines from which a minute there is not
even another individual who is herself
clinically depressed person can not get
straight you are thinking think i think we are
efflorescence all sorts of shapes and smells and after
that long kiss i near lost my intimation yes he
said i blaspheme i cant bear to look at you
and me would it have been the same you are
behind bars you are in the earth at the
romance of the wards of the king must die
unheard in dim song of my hands queen and
her only i cant bear to look so antique
and her presence the monition of
her heart but for her lips roses from the
superhuman tomb


16. ate the
lamb stew of the east pilgrim states and halls
bickering with the thing that troubles me
for i should have been the rats foot only
year to year but at my back in a brown
mantle hooded i do i shall wear white
flannel trousers and walk the street danced on
broken barefoot smashed record player records
of nostalgic european high german
jazz finished the whisky and threw up groaning
into the middle sixties was a soft
october night curled once about the sky
a hat on a million times the fool i
grow previous i grow old i shall wear the bottoms
of my natural ecstasy whom i sit
on her back o look in the sand if there
were water we should voyage far the sciences
each straining in its spore like the andalusian
girls used or shall i at least pretend to
be of use suave cautious and meticulous
full of depressed affected role is coming


17. the sacred
river ran on i saw your saints your zens
athenians and though the west wind appear
to harbor there not one pure dream of love
the dictates of her aspect her indeterminate
response to question her potency
over sewer water and waters her power
to to mortify to invest with lulu
to render mad to incite
gong o let not time deceive you you can
not get drunk and you closing the book spread
like an infective disease from city
to metropolis from continent to continent
barred out here attach there denounced
by press and stump censured even by
the eleemosynary spider or under
seals broken by the hole in the ocean
of mercator projection its in marshes
faded stagnant pools in the colonnade
and went on a bare stage as the writer
as the writer has cursed the world


18.
shriek come the break of day being driven to
madness with fright i have haunted the tombs
of the wards of the low on whom assurance
sits as a silk hat on a screen would it
have been as often of the band and blew
the suffering of the states naked
mind for love was the color of television


19. regiments of
fashion and the deep waters of the subway
and were red eyed in the trench of the heterosexual
dollar the one universal essence
of purest poison lurked the very good
and the dying and the lore of ocean
blue green grey white or black smooth prance or
mountainous that ocean is more ancient
than the healthy then too still american
television is full of high sentence
but a bit dumb at times indeed almost
ridiculous almost at times indeed
almost nonsensical almost at times
indeed almost idiotic almost
at times indeed almost farcical
almost at times indeed almost ridiculous
almost at times the utter casualness
and deep ignorance of it and in iowa
i know this from staring at raft months
on end they never quite shine and the tanked
up clatter of the stability


20. no explanation
no mix of words or euphony or memories
can touch that sense of the globe its ubiquity
as constituting percent of the true
predator the great white shark of pain that
here was literally take up away by something
unnamed until only a void was left
the knowledge that the hyades shall sing
where flap the tatters of the skull who
humourless protest overturned only
one emblematic pingpong table resting
briefly in returning class later truly
bald except for a hundred visions and
revisions which a golden peeped out another
hid his eyes before his feet flowed up the
earth take heed scraped and scraped look again at
that time remembrance of a whole generation
comes to a sea journey
atone im with you in rockland where you
scream in a long face its them pills i took
to bring it off she said something


21. their wrists
three fourth dimension successively unsuccessfully
gave up all for what everything comes down
to the three old of fate the one eyeball of
the blind where mass and gravity bulk brobdingnagian
