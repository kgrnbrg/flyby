madness with fright i have known belong now\\

the rattle of the railway love has no\\
windows and the staten island ferry\\

lean neck and thick hair and a clatter and\\
a stain of ink a bed yet soul had\\
loved him borne him in her arms and in realms\\
where the sun and they covered the roofs and\\
blocked the doors lurch apart this is the inability\\

look in the parks nightmare of the senses\\
im with you in rockland where there are only\\
you and time for the ancient heavenly\\
connection to the visible madman\\
doom of the skull who in unshaven rooms\\
in underclothes burning their money in\\
wastebaskets and listening to other peoples\\

of beer a sweetheart a package of coffin nail\\
a candle and fell asleep and waking\\
up again you pretender frere the chair\\
she sat in boxes breathing in the heavens\\
where the black clouds gathered far distant over\\
the jungle bow humped in silence then spoke\\

friend blood shaking my heart like sparks issued\\
from a farther room so how should iodine presume\\

summer and their friends the loitering heirs\\
of metropolis directors departed have\\
left no addresses by the drunken taxicabs\\
of absolute world who jumped\\
in the evening is spread out against the\\
sky above the antique mantel was displayed\\
\\
\\
3. youth entering\\
the whirlpool gentile or hebrew o you who\\
turn the wheel and here were forests ancient\\
as the sun of the use of the cross telepathy\\
and bop qabbala because the cosmos\\
instinctively at their feet in kansas river\\
who it through the negro streets at dawn looking\\
for an hour wearing bean shorts and a clatter\\
and a clatter and a stain of ink a\\
bed yet someone had loved his weak water\\

2. weave a\\
circle round him thrice and close your eyeball with\\
holy horrendous for he on honey dew hath\\
fed and drunk the milk of paradise lost\\
on an empty page think of an animal\\
is being smeared on the stair with a vision\\
of alcatraz and not for your pouring\\
height looming in tears like a rainbow over\\
some complex number for that madness\\
again that infinitive purdah\\
\\
\\
1. careful these\\
days unreal city under the wartime\\
blur floodlight of the universal pain\\
that turns finally into vanity\\
the cognition that this question was possible\\
pain that is not even at all and would\\
it have been the same view always alcatraz\\
like a taxicab throbbing waiting i though\\
blind pulsate between two lives old man with\\
three staves and here is the end according\\
\\
\\
9. now dying\\
with a compact shock and they had to\\
clear them away with digger and rakes so\\
that an almost occult unity\\
is achieved with a sword who lost their bones\\
what is that they are undetectable\\
by any outside party thus the forlornness\\
its a closed circuit the flow is both applied\\
and received from within where lounge at noon\\
where the plot where the walls of magnus martyr\\
\\
\\
7. the bones\\
and chortle spread from ear to ear a rat\\
crept softly through the stale beer afternoon\\
in desolate listening to the starry\\
dynamo in the waning moon i wish\\
some man or a woman ironing on a\\
mote of dust and fire swirling out of their\\
souls i steal into their dreams he said i\\
steal into their dreams he said i swear i\\
cant help it she said and give me a straight\\
\\
\\
5. of the\\
sunrise flashing posterior under barns and\\
naked in the parks nightmare of the bones\\
and chortle spread from ear to ear a rat\\
crept softly through the negro streets at dawn\\
looking for a furious fix burning for\\
the yellow smoke that rises from the sun\\
was it that i had died and been reborn\\
times but just commend especially because\\
the macrocosm instinctively at their feet\\
\\
\\
9. winning and\\
that was the color of television\\
tuned to a place where the beggars are coming\\
to townspeople and ran mad across golden gate\\
into sausalito and fell he passed\\
the stages of his innumerable\\
\\
\\
6. black folds\\
and absorbs into itself so that the\\
funeral procession could pass by we\\
are how simple we seem or at least a\\
main era the kind of eyes you can not\\
conquer time in the burrows of the problem\\
\\
\\
3. feeling it\\
goes by many names anguish desperation torment\\
or or more authoritative psycho\\
depression but kate down in the heavens\\
where the action of the ways that were his\\
eyes before his feet flowed up the earth listened\\
\\
\\
3. replaced and\\
become you and time for the synagogue\\
cast on the windows of the catalogue\\
a variable measure and the last\\
elephant in the magic moths warm of\\
heaven nothing like a lifetime\\
\\
\\
10. took place\\
like the andalusian young lady used or shall\\
i part my hair behind do i dare disturb\\
the macrocosm in a minute there is\\
always another one take the air beside\\
you and time will have his fancy tomorrow\\
or today into many a green shore\\
\\
\\
6. heap of\\
broken images where the smoke that rubs\\
its muzzle on the waves and surface particles\\
visiting in turn all points of its composition\\
two constituent parts of atomic number 1\\
with one bold stare one of the intrinsic\\
mind that finds and keeps but can not stop\\
\\
\\
5. asleep and\\
waking up again you hypocrite frere\\
the chair she sat in like a piece of forgotten\\
song drifting across the bay with orange\\
and silver bridges shuttling social organisation into\\
structure in this decayed hole among the\\
scholars of war the stunned governments\\
\\
\\
8. swell a\\
progress start a scene or two counsel the\\
prince no doubt at all it is an intuition\\
in which any of the poem of life\\
butchered out of the rocks as he rose and\\
fell asleep and indeed there will be no\\
special rushing then they went into the\\
ghostly clothes of jazz in the wings of gloom\\
\\
\\
3. you pun\\
on the ceiling vast fed with copper burned\\
green and orange framed by the terrace made\\
a sudden flash of the catalogue a\\
variable measure and the charm of\\
reality and of our thinking minds\\
but in the world has to kill them to break\\
them so of course it kills them the world would\\
\\
\\
1. on this\\
same diwan or bed i who have sat by\\
thebes below the tropic of capricorn\\
the stability of its primaeval\\
basin its bed oh keep the dog far hence\\
quaker to men or with his nails hell dig it\\
up again you phoney frere the chair\\
she sat in boxes breathing in the mainline\\
\\
\\
9. we are\\
rock rock and also water and the climbing\\
party is stuck on a mote of dust suspended\\
in a field where an endless strawman lay\\
its head on my lap how happily sore\\
\\
\\
10. by something\\
unidentified until only a void was left\\
the knowledge that the supreme note of art\\
had been struck in the fire sermon the rivers\\
tent is broken the last radio with\\
the earth all the eyes of my generation\\
destroyed by rabidness starving hysterical\\
naked dragging themselves through the arches\\
\\
\\
6. on sands\\
i can not be judged by any outside\\
party thus the desolation its a closed\\
railway car at four and we shall play a game of\\
the use of the intrinsic mind that these\\
ripples of birth and death and back turn upward\\
from the palaces of and my heart under\\
my feet are in their ears and other withered\\
\\
\\
4. long nose\\
of the moon screaming sick whispering\\
facts and memories and the thought of such\\
endless boulevard of fishy eyed vacancy\\
and death and back turn upward from the revelation\\
or flee from the shadow of this i do\\
i dare time to get the beauty of it\\
if an illusion lantern threw the nerves\\
\\
\\
3. all soaring\\
all around about the chapel there is\\
shadow under this ruby rock come in under\\
the brush her hair is heavy as burnished\\
gilt i could paint her not on canvas for\\
i should need shades and tones and hues and dyestuff\\
more splendid than the mountains but red sullen\\
faces leer and snarl from doors of houses\\
\\
\\
1. midnight glittering\\
with dust of gold of dust and fire nourishing\\
botany its infallibility\\
as paradigm and beau ideal\\
cloud cloud rain sleet snow hail its strength in rigid\\
tap its variety of forms in\\
and cipher nobody knows whats going\\
to happen to anybody also\\
\\
\\
9. in tears\\
like a burnished throne glowed on the radio\\
im with you in rockland where you paronomasia on\\
the low damp ground and bones cast in a handful\\
of dust suspended in a flash of lightning\\
then a damp blast bringing rain was sunken\\
and the one universal essence of\\
mind is pure machinery whose bloodline is running\\
\\
\\
4. put that\\
rock there never to roll down but in\\
the luminance delta of worlds he sits there\\
with his augurs rod of ash in take over\\
sandals by day beside a livid ocean\\
in violet nigh walking to a lower place a reign\\
of coarse stars i throw this ended shadow\\
from me call it the golden eternity\\
\\
\\
2. finally broke\\
and rolled back the soot that falls from chimneys\\
slipped by the barbarous king so rudely\\
forced yet there the nightingale filled all the\\
region below the wall at gate saturation\\
of air distillation of dew the easiness\\
of its doom not the tourist love of my\\
eyes failed i was there you have them all\\
\\
\\
10. falls into\\
panic desolation the sight of such\\
endless boulevard of fishy eyed vacancy\\
and death and rose reincarnate in the\\
roaring overwinter of brooklyn and kind king\\
light of mind is known that everything is\\
alright forever and forever close\\
your eyes let your hands and brass ends drop stop\\
\\
\\
7. skies but\\
stranger still are lost songs that the many\\
roofed village laid under the wartime blur\\
floodlight of the world and you will split the\\
heavens where the action of the intrinsic\\
mind that finds and keeps but can not get high\\
and beautiful wave so now to a lesser extent than five\\
years later truly denuded except\\
\\
\\
7. my whole\\
life was a very special time and who\\
therefore ran through the arctic streets obsessed\\
with a bald spot in the trench of the imagination\\
or digested the crab at the violet\\
air falling towers capital of israel athens\\
alexandria austrian capital london\\
unreal a woman but who is herself\\
\\
\\
4. of a\\
hell for one the authorized term\\
psychotic person depression makes kate feel especially\\
lonely specifically the psychotic person\\
part think of the pallid mask i pray god\\
will curse the writer as the sun of the\\
dead corner gives no shelter the cricket no\\
relief and the dead and i have seen them\\
\\
\\
3. down in\\
air were towers tolling evocative\\
bells that kept the minute and voices singing\\
out of the streets with their insanity\\
and plot the hebrew socialist rotation\\
against the western pitch weeping im sure\\
for vast door to open antique stores where\\
they let the children must be so careful\\
\\
\\
2. be free\\
that both hinge and lock die that all men be\\
free that both hinge and lock die that all men\\
be free that both flexible joint and lock die that all\\
doors if they close close like formosan bells was\\
it mans love to have the whole place swimming\\
in roses god of promised land nothing like\\
nature the wild mountains then the energy\\
\\
\\
10. dawning when\\
the evening star must be so careful these\\
days unreal city under the el and\\
saw the best minds of my natural ecstasy\\
whom i desert wake up in light streaming\\
out of the pacific exceeding eight\\
m fathoms the restlessness of its\\
waves and hinting in these ways of her aspect\\
