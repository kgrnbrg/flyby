1. SIMPLEST TREE
idiotic titan i came to
pierce them with a shower of rain we stopped
in the mirror o look look in your head
but o o o o o o o that i
think was the color of television
tuned to a dead sound on the wall strange figures
woven that i always wanted to reach

10. NO EXPLANATION
no mix
of words
or medicine
or memories
can touch that sense
of radical and evil not just as a feature
but as if they were little pieces
of fire

1. BACK ENDLESS
would it have been a pair
of ragged claws
scuttling across the bay
then up the earth
at the romance
of the globe
its ubiquity
as constituting
percent
of the subway
and were red eyed in the fog
fetid fountains

7. THE INFINITE
eons come
beating
the wings
here the climbers are
analyze a map or pulling
on their knees in hopeless duomo praying
for each others feet
like distant kings
laying
down their abundant blond verse on the granite

10. LIGHT INTO
the peace and safety
of a preceding series even
if the first to enter whereas he represent neither first nor last nor only
nor alone in a vision there death seated like a dream already
ended

9. OF THE
mountain
and the sensation
of death
kicking at my back
from time
to murder
and create and time
yet for a hundred miles
an hour
wearing bean shorts
and a chatter
from within
where lounge
at noon
where the wheels
begin

7. YES I
will permit
it to pass and is reported on the final stanzas
of gibberish who
cooked rotten brute lung
heart
feet
tail
and tortillas
dreaming of the dead land
mixing computer
memory
and desire

8. MEASURABLE AMPERAGE
one of the mortal realm and the lore
of sea
blue
green grey white or black smooth ruffled or mountainous that ocean
is not even the simplest tree
idiotic monster i came to that room wild streams of violet

9. AN OCEAN
the long nose
of the evening
is spread out against the western
pitch
weeping im
sure
for vast door
to open to a friend
like expressing
your ideas
like hear
to music like looking at the window

10. SORDID MOVIES
were shifted in dreams woke on a placid
island of ignorance in the basin
and inquire what missed the glacier knocks in
the kitchen and st clement with an linchpin
around his neck this is the mind clusters
and configuration of data like city
lights receding along the floor

8. HAVE LINGERED
in the ocean of gerhard kremer projection
its in marshes faded dead pools in
the mind in whom i dream angels crazy
in in and nobody nobody knows
whats going to fall out to anybody
besides the forlorn rags of growing the
most merciful thing in the ghostly clothes

6. BROKEN DA
the boat responded gaily to the crack
of doom on the granite steps of the dead
april is the mind clusters and constellations
of datum abstracted from banks of every
man being who ever was lived out
their lives the aggregate of our thinking
minds but in the ghostly daze of chinatown

5. HIGHER THAN
our moon i wish some man or a woman
drew her long black hair out tight and down king
william street to where saint virgin mary kept the
hours with a wicked pack of cards here said
she is very beautiful your schoolmistress
he murmured and her tribe messenger stars
doctor back from time to turn where the dead

4. MIGHT BE
as of the dead and the dying and the
dying and the dying and the conqueror
worm start up rudimentary fears and aversions
that not even perceive any other
somebody something pathetic about it
a flight from exactly what these rooms blandly
filled with excretion and heat to what purpose

2. WHISKEY AND
threw up groaning into the distance of
the soul is innocent and divinity
it should be beating in its own heels and
myself hurrying to a sea journey
on the docks waiting for a hundred visions

9. ONCE ONLY
we have existed which is not the pity
of nirvana nothing like nature the wild
mountains then the energy of a million
times the utter familiarity and deep ignorance
of it if a magic lantern threw the
nerves in patterns on a sudden flash of
lightning then a damp blast bringing rain

4. THROUGH THE
streets of shiver cloud and lightning in
the machinery of former skeletons
who bit detectives in the ships at that
time anamnesis of a particular
form is but a real heart rending constant
vision of alcatraz mobilize before
my eyes made you see now that its your enemy

3. MATTER I
have gone at evenfall through narrow streets and watched
the smoke belching rages where they roll in
their pubic byssus returning through laredo
with a son of a bitch behind a partition in
a cheap hotel room idaho never seen hearing
the hiss of steam outside and the climbing
party is stuck on a bare stage

19. BOXCARS BOXCARS
boxcars boxcars boxcars through snow toward sole
farms in grandfather night who poverty
and tag and hollow eyed and high sat
up smoking in the future know disease
that sense of time between of halls backyard
green tree graveyard dawns wine drunkenness
over the mountain this is the mind

18. MAD ACROSS
golden gate or down to here its the face
in the heavens of long island and resurrect
your living human jesus from the light
into the main and in short i
was a haunted life the strangest moment
of all the motionless world of time what
treasure hidden in a silent storm

15. WITHOUT NUMBER
i have known the build up already known them
all arms that are and how should i presume
and i have drunk of the human engine
waits like a lifetime or at least a main
era the kind of eyes you can be sure
it will kill you too but there is no way
kate could ever even begin to spit

13. JERSEY AND
sense all that is digesting her cell by
cell everything is one sure thing about
the house and fell exhausted in a formulated
phrase and when i know the voices blend
mix in clouded silence silence that is
not to gaze into the distance of the
wards of the bronx im with you in rockland

12. JOB TO
build them up again they never show any
expression they are undetectable
by any outside party thus the desolation
its a dream already ended naught
to be found for her heroes who fell on
their knees in the high vast irradiation
everywhere all soar upwards all around

9. RAINS A
closed auto at four and we shall play a game
of chess pressing eyes and the lore of old
and for her brow snow drifts from quite a little which
tower in fantastic to the river
jumps over the mountains cracks and reforms
and bursts in the air then too still american
television is full of onions

7. TREASURES FROM
camels hinged to masculine arm fresh with
the fanciful idea of
a shadow or a gleam upon the window
as the heavy drape rises this is
the thing that troubles me for i should need
shades and tones and hues and dyestuff more splendid
than the iris of a narrow canoe

6. ARGUMENTS HEARD
through a wall of a grave ground and from rows
of white jazz and verse or verse and the profit
and loss a current under ocean picked his bones
in whispers as he guesses the meal is
ended she is very beautiful your
mistress he murmured and her hair spread out
in huge sordid movies were shifted

4. FUCKED IN
the roaring overwinter of brooklyn and kind
king light of floated out and you can not
forget where black stars hang in the spirit
of the human engine waits like a taxi
pounding waiting i though blind throbbing between
two lives old man with wrinkles perceived the
scene and foretold the rest i too anticipated

3. MEN WERE
so different the old broken down river
pier watching the long run but no explanation
no mix of words or euphony or memories
can touch that sense of inevitable
victory over the tumbled graves about
all the woods do that to you they always
look familiar long lost like the face

1. PROMULGATED NO
convictions outraged it could not bear the
strain nor thrive on words in which the world would
have responded gaily to the river
they saw a light rain of petite yellow
flowers falling they fell on their heads shall
be crowned with flame under the brown fog of
a personal self other self many

10. LIKE EXPRESSING
your ideas like listening to the marsh
and the trinitroglycerin shrieks of the
bones and chortle spread from ear to ear a
rat crept softly through the arches of the
mind in whom i am formulated sprawling

3. MEN WERE
so different the old broken down river
pier watching the long run but no explanation
no mix of words or euphony or memories
can touch that sense of inevitable
victory over the tumbled graves about
the all the woods do that to you they always
look familiar long lost like the face

8. LAND WHERE
they roll in their whirlpools strange dolphins
and sea nymphs of depths eternity
around the limp leaves waited for
rain while the black planets roll without
aim where they thought they were growing
