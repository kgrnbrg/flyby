9. DEAD BRANCHES
above i have seen them riding seaward
on the docks waiting for what to make someone
else empathise what clinical depression
or instead of going home aimed the big
lightning across the quest bridge at a hundred
miles an hour wearing bean shorts and a chatter
from within where lounge at noon where the elevator
begins its ascension before the doors lurch
apart this is the final stroke of nine
there i saw your saints your zens athenians
and though the west coast investigating
the wonder at my cousins he
took me out of this i do not find the
creation of light a carved dolphin swam
above the antique mantlepiece was displayed
as though a window gave upon the beach
what twisted people we are great writers
on the apartment cliff banks of every
homo being who ever was lived out
their lives the aggregate of our species
lived there on a heath beneath winking stars
a fox red reek of the trench of the
healthy the words of the fiction we will
one day venture to the brooklyn bridge this
actually happened my key memory
of the verse form of life butchered out

4. I WAS
i was there you feel free i read much of
the king in yellow all felt that human being
nature could not awaken him a short
time later when the human system unthinkable
complexity lines of light in the fog
fetid fountains that ooze down to the memory
of his age and youth entering the maelstrom
gentile or jew o you who were burned alive
in that corner of time ah the diseased
sense of inevitable triumph over
the rooftops shopfront boroughs of joyride
neon blinking traffic light sun and they
covered the roofs and blocked the doors lurch apart
this is the merchant and this and so much
courage to this world the world would have responded
gaily to the west wind seemed to harbor
there not one stark dream of lets say hay like
universe golden heap on a placid
island of ignorance in the evening
star must be so careful these days unreal
city under the sky calls to us if
we do not ask what is it perfume from
a dress that makes me so he could feel my
breasts all perfume yes and drew him down to
the hand good with sail and oar the sea
have grown clear and to grant me glance

5. SUNS LAST
rays on the this music crept by me upon
the waves combing the white hair of the first
to enter whereas he is neither first
nor conclusion nor only nor alone in a
handful of dust and fire swirling out of
windows i should have stayed yet i left to
say yes my slew flower and first i
put my arms i hold within my hand grains
of the morbid even those who can manage
only a quite a little of broken images
where the roll finally broke and rolled back
the sky above the antique mantel
expose as though a window gave upon
the waters and along the rivers teeming
with people at cross purposes a billion
girls trembling in the void im with you in
rockland in my arms around him yes and
drew him down to here its the face is your
first night without her this is the night in
las vegas and look to windward consider
who was living cost now dead we who were
burned alive in that corner of time and
alarm clocks fell on their heads shall be crowned
with laurel in limbo who ate
the lamb stew of the globe its ubiquity
as constituting percent


2. AT CROSS
purposes a million wild looks disappointment
his back pack here and pitches his ragged
tent this is the moment of my eyes to
ask again yes and his way finding the
stairs she turns and looks a moment a broken
da the boat responded gaily when invited
beating obedient to command
hands i sat down and wept sweet thames run softly
for i have known the arms already known
them all their perfect bodies their perfect
manners as if a magic lantern threw
the nerves in patterns on a heath beneath
winking stars a fox red reek of the
tomb down the hall and ended fainting on
the lapp view always alcatraz like a
piece of leave song drifting across
the floors of silent seas and the last fantastic
book flung out of the ways beneath and these
glimpses have been the same view always alcatraz
like a kiss long and hot down to the brooklyn
bridge this actually take place and walked away
unknown and forgotten into the corners
of the sunrise flashing butt under
barns and naked in a that losing the
game of the loom who ecstatic and with
the years it grew more than friendly and spoke
