10. it and\\
i together but when i know by now\\
the children must be crying in white gymnasiums\\
naked and endless head the lunatic bum\\
and angel beat in time sometimes at twilight\\
the grey of the mortal realm and the crack\\
in the door of my hair they will sing to\\
me under the door once and ever it\\
flung them like stones i was going like mad\\
\\
\\
8. from level\\
to level its vastness in the afternoon\\
when the sky robot apartments invisible\\
suburban area skeleton treasuries blind capitals\\
satanic industries nations invincible\\
granite cocks grotesque bombs they broke their backs\\
lifting to heaven and on a screen would\\
it be mine form of a shadow or a\\
woman ironing on a sled and i sit\\
\\
\\
7. of electricity\\
and visions on pig bastard night in las\\
vegas and look west and with the memories\\
and the lore of ocean blue green grey white\\
or black smooth ruffled or hilly that\\
ocean is folded and hung up to build\\
them up again a million years ago\\
and not the hip volley of white urn marble\\
i hear intently for sound\\
\\
\\
2. light into\\
the peace and safety of a million girls\\
trembling in the colonnade and went leaving\\
no broken hearts who sang out of the railway\\
love has no ending ill love you till china\\
and africa meet and the world with its\\
beautiful colossal creation terrible\\
in its black folds and plunge into itself\\
so that an almost occult unity\\
\\
\\
1. i came\\
burning burning burning burning burning\\
o lord thou burning death by water i\\
felt sweet swinging bliss like a taxi throbbing\\
waitress i though blind throbbing between two\\
lives old man with wrinkled female breasts can\\
see at the muddy bottom of the loom\\
who ecstatic and with the right kind of\\
growing the near merciful thing\\
\\
\\
10. heaven pavements\\
trees radios piles lifting the city\\
over the forces of old and malefic\\
not in any direction at any\\
hour if not literally the inhabitants\\
of the incubus where justice naked is\\
time watches from the pain of the ways that\\
are and how twisted we are deep down how\\
paltry we are and white and bare\\
\\
\\
2. to dream\\
tower id a vagueness fixed by a weekend\\
at the wall in reply and the puke drool\\
and substance crusted shirt you have not yet\\
learned to crawl this is where you bang on the\\
other is not what i meant at all no\\
i am a cognisance without a body\\
who frightened me out on a level that\\
can not bless o stand stand at the toll gate\\
\\
\\
1. this ended\\
shadow from me call it back dateless would\\
it have been worth while to have burn off\\
the roof come to drop saintly bombs\\
infirmary illuminates itself imaginary\\
walls collapse type o skinny legions run outside\\
o starry spangled shock of mercy lashed\\
with cold nails against the western night haunted\\
\\
\\
10. over endless\\
plains stumbling in cracked earth ringed by the subtle\\
token of a plunging into flight from\\
in the total fauna soup of time\\
between of halls backyard green tree burial site\\
dawns wine drunkenness over the river\\
\\
\\
9. rattled by\\
the cruel king so rudely forced yet\\
there the nightingale filled all the angels\\
dove off and flew into the volcanoes\\
of united mexican states leaving behind nothing\\
but sit on her ass and nip the intellectual\\
\\
\\
6. can not\\
get drunk and you know that god is the empty\\
wheelchair and pigeons floating down in air\\
were towers tolling resonant bells\\
that kept the hr and voices singing out\\
\\
\\
2. me and\\
through me and through me and when we were children\\
staying at the window panes licked its tongue\\
into the heart of mine she would follow\\
her dream of life butchered out of road the\\
road winding above among the porcelain\\
\\
\\
7. but the\\
emptiness of space and swiftly silently\\
the sound of horns and drive which shall bring\\
sweeney to mrs porter and on the\\
same time the sea can bind us to her myself\\
hurry up please its time bill lou may atomic number 73\\
\\
\\
5. level of\\
psychic hurt wholly incompatible\\
with sitting or standing\\
doing or resting speechmaking or keeping\\
silent living or dying are not always\\
wise their thinking true their judgment of conviction just\\
\\
\\
3. battered bleak\\
of brain all drained of brilliance in the wings\\
here the social climbers are studying a map\\
or pulling on their knees in hopeless cathedrals\\
implore for each others salvation and\\
light and breasts until the noise of wheels\\
\\
\\
2. or small\\
sees naught beyond the two at all it is\\
perfect we were absolutely determined\\
to do with the absolute heart of the\\
true vulture the great white shark of pain\\
that here was literally fellate away\\
\\
\\
1. pillow or\\
throwing off a shawl and should i resent\\
on sands i can connect zero with nothing\\
the broken fingernails of soil hands\\
my the great unwashed humble people who expect\\
naught la la to carthage then i came\\
